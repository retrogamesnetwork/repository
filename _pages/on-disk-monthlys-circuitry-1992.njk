description: On Disk Monthly's Circuitry is a Tetris -style game where the
  player needs to connect one side of a 'well' to another with a 'circuit' of
  similar blocks. There are ten kinds of blocks, including 'stopper' blocks
  which permanently occupy a position on a game field, and 'universal' blocks,
  which complete any circuit. Blocks can be 'devalued' by one block type. The
  game ends when the field overflows. Blocks fall faster and faster as the game
  progresses.
