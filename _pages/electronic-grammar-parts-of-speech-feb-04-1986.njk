description: "Cutesy critters EG (pronounced Eegee) and his friends Blip and the
  Its are your hosts in this game which, true to its title, imparts knowledge of
  the English grammar, with chapters covering the different parts of speech -
  from nouns and pronouns to conjunctions and interjections, and everything in
  between.  Short summaries of the subject matter are presented, followed by
  free-response or multiple choice questions: correct answers are rewarded with
  EG's excited hopping, whereas mistakes will just have him slowly shaking his
  head (and explaining your error). Once a chapter is completed, a summary page
  shows you how well you've done. Two review lessons can be taken to wrap things
  up - these offer a mixed bag of questions covering several topics."
