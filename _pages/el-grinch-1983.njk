description: "The objective of El Grinch is to capture the titular Grinch, an
  elusive bug-like creature, whose hobbies seem to include (1) hiding in
  bean-bushes and (2) eating all day.  You'll have to locate the little pest
  within the 10-by-10 bean field, by guessing which plant he's hiding in. When
  you examine your chosen location, the Grinch will make a sound: the closer he
  is, the shorter his chirp -- only by listening carefully you can home in on
  his location.  If you still can't catch the sneaky vermin after 7 attempts,
  you can either go for a hint (to narrow down the possibilities) or give up."
