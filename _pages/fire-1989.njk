description: "In Fire! the player mans an advanced helicopter and tries to solve
  some of humanity's problems by shooting at them. The game consists of five
  thematically unrelated levels which consist of two stages each, e.g. in one
  mission the player has to destroy drug plants in South America and another one
  requires to deal with terrorists at sea. Regarding gameplay, this is a
  traditional, horizontally scrolling shooter: the player moves from left to
  right while shooting everything which moves. Shields and fuel are limited and
  if one reaches zero, the one and only life is lost. However, they can be
  refilled with power ups which are left behind from killed enemies. The
  standard gun can be either aimed straight or slightly downwards, but by
  picking up the correct power ups the weapon system can be upgraded."
