description: Apachacha is a side-scrolling action game with light platforming
  elements, starring a Native American warrior who must save the land from an
  evil demon and his minions. The player advances from stage to stage in a
  strictly linear fashion. The stages themselves are fairly straightforward,
  dominated by enemies rather than hazards. The warrior can accumulate and use
  several throwing weapons simultaneously, and also execute a powerful melee
  attack that depletes his special energy bar. This bar can be restored with
  items left by enemies upon defeat. Each stages ends with a boss battle. There
  is no save feature in the game.
