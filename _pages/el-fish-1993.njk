description: A fish and aquarium simulator, El-Fish lets your catch, breed,
  evolve, and even mutate tropical fish, then render them and let them loose in
  an aquarium that you design. Except for a few pre-canned graphics and
  animations, all fish, plants, and even backdrops and floor gravel in El-Fish
  are generated by the user using genetic algorithms that simulate real life in
  both appearance and movement.  Even the music you want to play in the
  background can be generated with one of eight musical styles.
