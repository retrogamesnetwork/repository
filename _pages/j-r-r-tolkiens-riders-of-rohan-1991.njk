description: "Another J.R.R. Tolkien based game, but specifically focused on the
  Two Towers story, starting right before the siege of Helm's Keep: the battle
  between the defending forces of Rohan and the attacking legions of the evil
  wizard Saruman. The game introduces a similiar style of play as War in Middle
  Earth, that is a macro-world map point of view which operates battles and
  movement of mass armies, and there's a micro point of view, a more 'action'
  approach where the original characters of the Fellowship can battle enemies at
  a smaller scale: Shoot orcs from a ranged distance, fight them melee in an
  arcade fighting style or challenge them in a duel of magic."
