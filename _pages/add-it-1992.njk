description: "Add It! is an educational game for children who want to learn
  counting. It presents a mathematical question to the player, and by clicking
  on a number in a table you suggest an answer for each exercise. When it's
  right, then you get the next exercise and when your answer is wrong, the
  program says \"Oooops!\" and you can try again. But don't worry, you have
  unlimited tries. There are two difficulty levels: In \"easy\" the sum of the
  addition is between one and ten, in \"hard\" between one and twenty."
