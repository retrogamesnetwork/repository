description: The Skweeks lived in harmony for centuries, being a naturally
  peaceful peoples, until Pitark arrived. He ruined their bright pink land by
  removing the colour, and it was only after he died that they had the
  opportunity to clean the land up. Your job is to travel through the 99
  continents and clean each one in sequence. Skweek can move in each of the four
  compass directions, and is armed with a simple weapon, whose shots rebound
  around before they hit one of Pitark's minions, the Schnoreuls - contact with
  which is instantly fatal. Some squares contain arrows which force you in a
  particular direction, while there are also blockades to avoid. Bomb squares
  blow up surrounding squares but give you time to move away from them as they
  do this, while Shortcut squares allow you to move to another teleport-type
  square by pushing the joystick in its direction.
