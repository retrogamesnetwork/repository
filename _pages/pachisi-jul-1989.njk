description: Pachisi is an ancient game thought to have originated in India.
  Modern western variants include the board games Sorry! and Ludo. The game is
  played by rolling a dice and moving counters around the outside of a cross
  shaped game area. Pachisi is for four players and in this shareware version
  the computer can substitute for one, two or three of those players. To win the
  game a player must be the first to move all of their counters around the board
  and into the centre.
