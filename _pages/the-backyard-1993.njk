description: The Backyard is an educational game for toddlers that is set in a
  child's backyard. Everything within the backyard can be clicked on, resulting
  in an activity, or at least an amusing animation. The Backyard is the third in
  a trilogy of games for toddlers that include The Playroom, and The Treehouse.
  Children are presented with activities that encourage development in
  associating facial expressions with the words that describe them, map reading
  and making, animal identification, and of course, numbers and letters.
