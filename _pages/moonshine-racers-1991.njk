description: Ike and Billy Joe are running illegal booze around the US, and you
  must take control of their vehicle and make sure they complete each part of
  their journey. The action is viewed from above and behind the car, in a
  similar manner to the OutRun and Lotus games. Gameplay is a sort of reverse
  Chase H.Q., as you aim to flee Sheriff Sam's staff, without destroying your
  car or running out of time. As well as typical car upgrades, between stages
  you can also buy maps, which will help you plan your route. The game's
  atmosphere includes banjo-based background music and CB radio sounds, for that
  authentic Midwest feel.
