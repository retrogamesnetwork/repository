description: At heart, this is a collection of three different Breakout variants
  (Brick Wall, Falling Walls, and The Blast Adventure), dished up in the
  trademark Moraffware style of eye-popping, fauvist colour in more supported
  video resolution modes than you might previously have believed existed.  In
  all modes gameplay is primarily concerned with bouncing a ball off a paddle on
  the bottom of the screen and into blocks or bricks suspended above, destroying
  them.  In Falling Walls, as you might have been able to guess, the suspension
  is not complete, while in The Blast Adventure game mode, priority is on
  removing obstructions from around a gateway to the next level rather than on
  eliminating all bricks from the screen.  In all modes, various conventional
  power-up types assist the player in their brick demolition.
