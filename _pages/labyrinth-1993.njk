description: ŒºLabyrinth is a puzzle game, where the player should guide an
  object across a magnetic field, which cells have different polarity. The
  magnetic field is auto-generated each time the player starts the level. Taking
  into account the principle of magnetic fields superposition, the player by
  turns should assign red (south) or blue (north) polarity to the object to make
  it move to the next cell in the magnetic field. In case of equilibrium state
  for the object in the current cell, the player can choose the movement
  direction on his own. It is restricted to return back to the cell already
  visited, or to leave the field, otherwise the control over the object will be
  lost. Points are achieved for timed-based passing the level. Highest points
  are stored in the top seven table.
