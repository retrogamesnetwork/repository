description: L. Runner II is a single-player, shareware platform puzzle game.
  The player is presented with a series of screens on which there are multilevel
  platforms from which hang vines and so on. Scattered around the platforms are
  treasure chests and obstacles such as water hazards. The object of the game is
  to collect all the available treasure on each screen and so progress to the
  next. This is complicated by the platforms some of which degrade as the player
  walks over them so finding the optimum route across the level is essential.
  The game is entirely keyboard controlled and the registered version has over
  ninety such levels.
