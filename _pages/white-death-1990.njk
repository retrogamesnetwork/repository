description: White Death is based on of the board game of the same name and
  deals with the fights around the Russian village Velikiye Luki in 1942. There
  are six scenarios, dealing with different phases of the fight, and the player
  either takes the role of the German or Russian side of the conflict. This is
  one of those game which try to simulate not only the scenario but also the
  warfare and its tactics as closely as possible. Shown from the typical
  top-down view on a map with hex grids, the player gives orders to the units
  through a menu system. The units are represented by icons which each have a
  little bar showing their strength and movement. Other examples for the things
  the player needs to take into account are morale, terrain, support and a
  tactical wise unit placement/movement.
