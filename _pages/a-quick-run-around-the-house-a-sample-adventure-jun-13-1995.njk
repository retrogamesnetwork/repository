description: "A Quick Run Around the House: A Sample Adventure was created by
  Roger Kenner, the author of the Adventure Game & Interactive Fiction
  Generator, to demonstrate the abilities of his teaching tool. The player
  searches a house for a disk containing Kenner's programme. The interface
  consists of two parts: the upper part of the screen contains a written
  description of the scenery and the lower part contains two rows of commands.
  The upper part changes depending on the situation; usually there are just the
  directions the player may try to move next (the cardinal directions, up and
  down) listed. The lower row never changes and allows to get word explanations,
  get objects, use an object, list the inventory or put something down. All
  those commands are associated with a key and sometimes, e.g. when trying to
  take something, a pop-up menu comes up and the player has to choose an object
  from a list."
