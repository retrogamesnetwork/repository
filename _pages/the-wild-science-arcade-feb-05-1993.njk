description: "In Wild Science Arcade, kids learn about physics by maneuvering a
  ball using four variable settings: gravity, friction, ball material and
  initial force. Although it resembles visually the classic Marble Madness, the
  gameplay is easier, aimed at the younger gamer. The game is divided in 5
  levels, each with several rooms. You progress by guiding the ball to the exit
  hole in each of this rooms. After you complete each level, you receive a warp
  code for the next one, thus requiring some degree of literacy from the child."
