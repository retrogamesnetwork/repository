description: Slater the Petrosaur, protagonist of Sierra's Oil's Well remake,
  has got himself a buddy in the form of Charlie, another dinosaur of
  indeterminate species.  Together, they visit various locations and undertake
  various tasks toward the end of enjoying a camping trip in the great outdoors
  together. The game is presented as a series of static images, described in
  text at the bottom of the screen -- then optionally narrated for children
  whose reading skills aren't yet up to keeping up with the plot.  After each
  description has been read, the illustrations can be interacted with like a
  pop-up book, numerous hidden hot spots on every page yielding zany + whimsical
  animations.
