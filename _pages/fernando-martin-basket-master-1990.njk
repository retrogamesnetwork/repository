description: "\"Basket Master\" is a one-on-one basketball game from premier
  Spanish developer Dinamic Soft, dedicated to NBA player Fernando Mart√≠n, the
  first Spanish (and first European non-student in a US university) to play in
  the NBA, who tragically died 3 years later in a traffic accident at the age of
  28. The focus is on pure, unadulterated action here: just choose one- or
  two-player game, and presto-- you'll be out on a CGA court trying to score.
  Although difficulty level can be toggled (\"amateur\" or \"NBA\"). Basket
  Master was originally for 8 bits computers, platforms for which appeared
  December of 1986 after several delays."
