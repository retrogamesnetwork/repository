description: "Dinosaur Adventure is an educational game that teaches about
  dinosaurs. It comes on three disks and includes full motion video. It consists
  of different sections. In the first one a dinosaur storybook can be read. It
  consists of a series of still images with a voice that narrates the story.
  There are interactive elements. For instance, the dinosaurs in the images can
  be clicked and then their name is read out loud. The second activity is the
  Name-A-Saurus game. The name of a dinosaur is displayed and then the
  corresponding picture needs to be selected from an overview. The third
  activity is the Read-A-Saurus game. This is the opposite of the previous one:
  a picture is shown and the correct name needs to be selected from a list. The
  fourth activity lets players explore the history of dinosaurs through an
  interface that resembles an interactive encyclopedia. It shows Earth in the
  top left corner and the player can rotate it or scale to change the distance.
  The bottom of the screen holds a timeline. By moving the slider the different
  periods are shown and explained. The top of the screen has buttons to explore
  a library, print, read about archaeological activities and fossils, watch
  movies about dinosaurs, learn the difference between herbivores and
  carnivores, and explore the life and extinction of the animals. The last
  activity has an overview of all available movies. At any moment it is possible
  to leave an activity and return to the main menu to start a new one."
