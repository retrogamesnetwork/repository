  arcade focus. You can freely choose which missions to fly first, and which
  helicopter to fly in a given mission. There are a total of four helicopters:
  Apache, Blackhawk, Osprey and LHX. With this fine selection of death machines
  you will engage countless enemy targets in Libya, East Germany and Vietnam
  throughout the game."
