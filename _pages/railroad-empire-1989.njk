description: In 1992, Maxis published A-Train, a railroad management simulation
  by Artdink, a developer of some renown in Japan but virtually unknown anywhere
  else. A-Train was the third episode in Artdink‚Äôs Take the A-Train series,
  which dates back to 1986. An earlier installment of the series had been
  internationally published three years prior to Maxis‚Äô A-Train by Seika Corp.,
  under the name of Railroad Empire, with little to no public recognition. In a
  goal-oriented approach, your task as a railroad tycoon is to build a
  trans-continental track that connects New York with California in the US
  scenario, England with Turkey on the (considerably more challenging) Europe
  map. With transportation service limited to passengers only and scheduling
  options minimized, creating smoothly running train lines is comparatively easy
  ‚Äì just make sure that trains don‚Äôt collide on the single-track lines. The main
  focus is on efficient track building using the A-Train, which you control
  directly. A limited supply of rails and geographical barriers such as rivers
  with few pre-constructed bridges make careful planning essential. Optional
  cargo trains help distributing building materials to the station closest to
  your A-Train. In a unique feature, days pass in an accelerated real-time
  day/night cycle, with track-building only possible during daylight and changes
  to train schedules and switches only allowed at night.
