description: "A slightly isometric top-down tennis game between two players,
  either computer or human. Players can choose three types of field to play on:
  grass, dirt or clay as well as three difficulty settings. Players can create a
  new character and save its statistics to track its progress. The game features
  the standard rules of tennis, where a ball must be hit over the net into the
  opposing player's area of the court."
