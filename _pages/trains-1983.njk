description: Trains is a top-down managerial game. In the age of steam-powered
  trains, there are opportunities to make money on great railroads. It will be
  up to the player to take control of a train on a railroad and turn a profit.
  The player does this by moving the train to a loading station that will supply
  raw material, and stopping in front of it with the appropriate car and blowing
  the whistle to begin the loading process. This is then delivered to the
  stations of industries that need them, unloading taking place the exact same
  way. The faster goods are delivered, the more money is made, with extra
  profits available when an industry is in critical need of a supply. Meters of
  available industry supplies can be shown on the screen. The train itself can
  only be stopped and move forwards and backwards, following the path of the
  train track, left and right movement is used only at switches, where the track
  splits into two directions. Each action of train movement uses coal,
  multiplied by the weight of the goods being carried. Coal is resupplied at the
  coal yard, and is loaded into the coal car the same way as other goods,
  spending money in order to buy coal. If the player runs out of coal while
  driving the train, it will cost them twice as much to have the coal delivered
  to the train. Every 3 minutes, $200 is deducted from the player for payroll
  and any crashed train costs another $200 in penalties. Each level is a unique
  track design, and can take place across cities, deserts, mountains and plains.
  As industry supplies are managed, a track is gradually built at the edge of
  the screen which will lead to the next level.
