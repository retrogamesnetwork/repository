description: Jenny of the Prairie focuses on a girl who stranded in the prairie
  after being separated from her wagon train in 1842. As Jenny, the player must
  prepare for the coming winter by gathering food and having a warm shelter by
  the time it get's cold. The historical background and the challenge presented
  are also meant to foster problem solving skills among children, specifically
  girls. At the beginning, a choice of three different skill levels is offered,
  and the player is also asked if he wants to build a lean-to in a clearing, or
  tame a fox and live in a cave. Afterwards, the main quest for survival starts,
  in which multiple screens can be explored with the character. Jenny can be
  moved and interact with the environment via keyboard commands. Scores can be
  displayed for monitoring progress concerning the collection of firewood, food,
  and a cape for the winter. Certain actions such as picking up things require
  the input of words. An example of a useful tool is the spear, which may be
  used for hunting. The player does not necessarily need to kill animals, as
  plants also can serve as food sources (berries are an example), but there is
  wildlife such as a rattlesnake which poses danger and may end the game when
  Jenny encounters it.
