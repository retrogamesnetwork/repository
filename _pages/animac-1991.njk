description: "23rd-century Earth is a good place to be: after an atypically
  friendly first contact with an alien species, the planet's ills have been
  cured and peace reigns supreme.  But some will always resist change, let alone
  utopian ideas.  One such organization was the innocently-named American
  Neutral Investigators, and its leader Mapier was exiled off-planet for
  disturbing the peace.  This decision did not prove far-sighted however; Mapier
  worked diligently, pirating and destroying, harvesting debris, alien
  technology and raw materials, and gradually built up a huge armed space
  fortress from which the ANI continue to terrorize known space. This is where
  the player comes in, piloting an infiltrator ship into the bowels of the ANI's
  Mapierian Anti-Complex (ANIMAC) to find and destroy the central command.  The
  meandering tunnels burrowing through the planet-sized base consist of hundreds
  of different rooms, littered with automated defenses, mines and hostile
  drones, while the Infiltrator only packs a single forward-firing photon
  launcher.  Bridges and invisible warps complicate matters further, as does the
  security system which makes backtracking a deadly risk."
