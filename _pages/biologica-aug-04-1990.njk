description: An educational game that taught the player how life started on
  Earth, how biologists classify life, and how the primordial soup evolved into
  the first multi-cellular life forms and then simple organisms. It featured two
  mini-puzzle games with 8bit graphics and sounds. The most interesting part was
  what I could only compare to a primitive, but still neat little version of the
  game of life. It let you create simple viruses, bacteria, and amoeba-like
  organisms using random seeds. You could then watch the items replicate and
  eat, and eventually die, all in 8bit color and in DOS.
