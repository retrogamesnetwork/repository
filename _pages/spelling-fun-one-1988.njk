description: You have been locked in a castle by Erlking of Errors, the Spelling
  Serpent.  You must move through all the rooms in the castle until you can find
  the Key of Gold and escape.  To move between rooms a word is flashed on the
  screen and begins to fade away.  You must correctly type the word to proceed
  to the next room.  Once you have built up enough strength (points) some rooms
  will have teleporters to move up to higher floors.  The gold key is hidden in
  one of three tower rooms at the very top of the castle.  Once the gold key has
  been found, you must find your way back to the first room in the castle where
  you can exit and finish the game. A number of word lists are included of
  varying difficulty, and custom word lists can be created.
