description: Krkal 1 is a puzzle action top-down DOS game from 1997. It is in
  Czech language only and today it can be played under DOSBox. You‚Äôll try to
  control one of three characters, you‚Äôll help them overcome all obstacles and
  make them to the exit. The game is based on these obstacles (game objects) -
  they are various, their volume is large and they mutually complement each
  other. You will need quick fingers, as well as a sharp mind, since in later
  levels the game gets hard! In Krkal 1 you‚Äôll find for example traditional keys
  and locks, conveyor belts, ice, explosives, monsters, switches, mirror
  directed lasers, magnets and much, much more. Thanks to this the game can
  offer highly various levels. The game also contains levels editor. Krkal was
  inspired by Robbo, Boulder Dash, Supaplex or Sokoban.
