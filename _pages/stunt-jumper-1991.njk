description: Stunt Jumper lets you drive a bike on a ramp and jump over a series
  of yellow school buses. The player has three lives and needs to keep the speed
  correct to match the number of buses so as to land on the down-ramp without
  crashing. Too slow, and you crash into a bus between the ramps, too fast and
  you land too hard on the ground, losing a life. The only controls are
  'spacebar' to accelerate, and 'ctrl' to break. Your view is over the
  handlebars of the bike, looking ahead towards the road, with the ramp
  initially out of sight. There is little to guide you as to what the proper
  speed may be, so you have to use trial and error for the first few times. Each
  time you succeed landing correctly, you get another try with more buses
  between the ramps. The objective is to end up on the top of the score board
  before you lose all three lives. If you lose all lives, you restart the game
  from the beginning, jumping over three buses.
