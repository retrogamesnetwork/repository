description: 'Masterblazer is both a remake of and a follow-up to the Lucasfilm
  Games game Ballblazer. Ballblazer is a futuristic sport played in vehicles
  called "Rotofoils". The play field is a large rectangle made out of squares.
  The object of the game is to get a ball called "Plasmorb" into the goal, which
  moves along the edge of the play field. Otherwise, the rules are simple:
  "Three minutes, two players, one victor!" The game is played in first-person
  on a split screen and can be played by either one or two players. Compared to
  Ballblazer, Masterblazer offers two new playing options: a Tournament Mode and
  a Rotofoil Race.'
