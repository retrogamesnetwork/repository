description: This Tetris version is an unofficial DOS adaptation of the puzzle
  game. At the top of the screen blocks appear one at a time. These blocks move
  slowly downwards where they pile up. The player can rotate and move the blocks
  so they form lines, which will then disappear. The longer the game lasts, the
  faster the blocks fall down.
