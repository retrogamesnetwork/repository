description: Sorcerer Lord is a medieval fantasy game of tactical warfare. The
  evil Shadowlord's army is threatening to overrun the peaceful country of
  Galanor. The alliance of races in Galanor isn't very fond of suppression,
  slavery or extinction, so they are preparing for war -- it's your job to
  coordinate the Galanorian defense. Movement and combat are turn-based. You and
  the Shadowlord alternately recruit new troops, move armies on a 2D hex-map of
  the land and try to conquer the enemies garrisons. The outcome of fights is
  shown as plain text only. Although the gameplay is quite simple, there are a
  few tactical knacks like certain races fighting more fiercely in certain
  terrain types, fatigue levels and basic statistics for army leaders. Despite
  the game's title, magic is a rather unimportant element of chance in battles
  and not under your direct control. The game contains a time limit; you've got
  40 turns in easy level, less in advanced levels.
