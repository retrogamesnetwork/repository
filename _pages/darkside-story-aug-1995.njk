description: "The dentist Dr. O Sang Hyun lives in the suburbs with his wife and
  their daughter Suhee. Everything goes well until one day he disappears without
  a trace. Suhee must now travel to the shadier districts of the city and use
  her brawling as well as negotiating skills to find out what happened to her
  father. Darkside Story is primarily a beat-em-up, though it also contains
  extensive sequences that involve Suhee wandering around the city, entering
  houses, and talking to their inhabitants in order to receive the next bit of
  information and advance the story. In the beginning the player controls only
  Suhee, but later in the game other characters become available as well. The
  fighting is done in a standard beat-em-up fashion: the protagonist has to
  eliminate all the enemies on screen before being able to advance to the next
  area. Characters have different attributes and can use punches, kicks,
  combinations thereof, and special attacks that deplete their HP. Each HP bar
  equals one heart; Suhee starts with three hearts, but advancing the plot
  gradually awards her and the other characters with more. HP-restoring items
  can be picked up by destroying barrels and other objects in the stages."
