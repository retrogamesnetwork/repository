description: "Troika is a collection of three arcade style games: Rebel Planets,
  Ivan's Time Machine, and Metal Hearts, from Russian programmer Dima Pavlovsky.
  Rebel Planets is an arcade shooter where you control a small ship at the
  bottom of the screen and shoot a cylindrical projectile upwards. The goal is
  to destroy enemies on the screen with the projectile while making sure the
  projectile does not come into contact with various obstacles scattered around
  the screen. This plays like a cross between Space Invaders and Breakout.
  Ivan's Time Machine is a puzzle game in which the objective is to collect all
  the money on the game screen by wending your way through a maze in which you
  have to move blocks out of the way to open up passages, you have move these
  blocks in the correct order or else you trap yourself or seal yourself off
  from parts of the maze. This is very similar to the popular Japanese puzzle
  game Sokoban. In Metal Hearts you play the role of a plumber whose job it is
  to connect two water mains together using a changing series of elbow joints
  and straight sections. You are in a race against the clock as the water begins
  to flow down the pipe you are building from the input to the output. This is a
  clone of the game Pipe Dream."
