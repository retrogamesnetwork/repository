description: Satirical video games are generally more effective if they look and
  play anything remotely like their inspiration ( Untima a better example in
  this case), but that hasn't kept a couple of teens from throwing together a
  side-scrolling homage to the wispy plots, repetitive gameplay and spotty use
  of Olde Tyme Englishe diction strewn throughout the Ultima series (also
  initially, it should be noted, the handiwork of a couple of teens.) You play a
  wizard, advancing step-by-step ever to the right side of the screen across the
  harsh wilderness landscape of what amounts to a Grade 2 student's first
  attempt at using MS Paint.  Enormous, static, intentionally-crudely-rendered
  monsters block your path, but they are easily dispatched by close use of the "
  A" key, to attack.  Various statistics are kept track of, incrementing and
  decrementing as you move, fight and kill, replenished by giant magical potions
  dotting the landscape.  At the end of each level is a huge golden amulet --
  alas, decoys all of them.  Every subsequent level plays identically to the
  prior, save that the monsters require an additional hit to do away with.
