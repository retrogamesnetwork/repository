description: Glook is a side-scrolling shooting game similar to Defender. The
  player controls a small armed flying craft and must fend off invading aliens
  that try to abduct humans. To complete a stage, the player needs to destroy
  all Hunters, the aliens that that can capture humans, but there are also other
  types of aliens that attack the player. Glook can be played by one or two
  players on the same computer. In a two-player game, players take turns to
  fight the aliens until either the stage is complete or they run out of lives.
