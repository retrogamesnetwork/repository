description: "During the span of history, there have been many great strategists
  that have lead their troops to victory. The greatest of these are known as
  Battle Lords and are respected greatly. In a tournament to discover the
  greatest of these battle lords, great warriors have been pulled out from
  different eras and available to be controlled by the strategists. The Battle
  Lords will make their champions fight 1 on 1 amongst themselves to find out
  who can triumph over all others and obtain the highest ranking. The Battle
  Lord who can master his will over different warriors will become the Ruler of
  the Battle Lords. Battle Wrath is a side-scrolling fighting game. The player
  starts by naming their Battle Lord and then choosing to duel with an enemy
  battle lord (either computer or another player) in a sanctioned (adjacent
  rank) or unsanctioned (very different rankings) fight. Each Battle Lord then
  chooses a character from amongst the available 8 different warriors. These
  characters then appear in an arena and must deplete each other's energy. The
  player has two attack buttons, one for arms (punches) and one for legs
  (kicks), which can be used with the directional keys to perform a variety of
  moves. If the enemy is hit a certain way, decapitation can occur (though this
  can be disabled as \"PG Mode\" in the options), which limits the attacks
  available from that player. Each character also has a unique \"special move\",
  which deplete power gems. These power gems can be gathered by having the
  character stand still and charge up. Each character also has a \"Battle
  Wrath\" special move which can only be used when the Battle Lord is ranked #1
  (and therefore is the Ruler), likewise better ranking enhances the normal
  character abilities."
