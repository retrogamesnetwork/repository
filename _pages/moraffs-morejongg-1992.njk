description: Moraff's Morejongg is a single player, shareware, Mahjong game.
  This game has twenty different tile layouts, several different tile sets
  including traditional, monster, letters, words and colours, in addition the
  colours used on the tile sets can be changed to make them easier to see. The
  game is played entirely with the mouse and is similar to other tile matching
  maj jong games, pairs of identical tiles disappear and the object is to remove
  them all from the game area. This game does have a hint and an undo feature
  but there is no high score table and no reshuffle feature.
