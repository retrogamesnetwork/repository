description: This football simulation focuses on international football,
  allowing you to play a tournament or single friendly matches. Up to 8 human
  players can be involved in the tournament. Options include three skill levels,
  variable match lengths and a choice of sound or music (or both on some
  versions). The match is viewed from the side, although it switches to a 3D
  view when the ball is close to the goal. The ball roughly sticks to the
  player's foot. Set pieces are controlled by moving an aiming cross-hair.
