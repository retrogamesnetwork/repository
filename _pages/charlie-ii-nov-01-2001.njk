description: "Charlie II is the successor of Charlie the Duck. Once again, you
  playing the duck Charlie across many different levels in this platformer. The
  game contains 18 levels, with different worlds. Some levels are hidden, and
  can only be accessed through a secret exit. After the end of 6 levels, you
  must face a boss. You begin your adventure by choosing the difficulty level
  you want to play (easy, normal, and hard). The difficulty level will affect
  how much treasure you must find in the level. If you exit the level earlier
  than finding the percentage needed, you have to replay the level, as long as
  you not succeed in finding enough treasure. In easy you must find 55%, in
  normal it's 65%, and in hard it's 75% of all coins & diamonds in the game.
  Some are visible, some are hidden. In a level, you have no weapons to defeat
  an enemy. However, you can jump on top of them, or using a shield to defeat
  them. Charlie has both health and lives, if you get hit by an enemy, you loose
  one of your hearts (the health). If you loose all of them, you loose a life.
  If you jump or fall on top of spikes, you immediately die. The initial number
  of hearts depends on the difficulty. Charlie can not only run and jump, he can
  only dive. This is needed to find hidden areas in the level. On his adventure,
  Charlie can find a lot of Power-Ups, mostly hidden in crates, which shatters
  if you jump on top of them. The following Power-Ups can you find: Heart (will
  increase Charlie's health by filling up hearts), Super Heart (will give an
  extra heart; means when you had 2, you now have 3), Egg (will provide Charlie
  with an extra life), Letters (there are an A, a C, an E, a H, an I, a L, and a
  R in a level; if you find them, they will form his name and when you will have
  them all, you get an extra life), Shield (will make Charlie invulnerable for a
  moment)."
