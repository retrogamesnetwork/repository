description: "In the third game of the adventure game series Zork, you are once
  again a nameless adventurer, only this time you won't travel through a
  beautiful magical land, but are immediately cast into a deep dungeon. Like in
  a dream, you hear a mysterious voice telling you that you have passed all the
  tests but one. When consciousness returns to you, you find yourself on the
  endless spiral of stairs, with only your trusty lantern near you... will you
  be able to survive the horrors of the Dungeon? Like its predecessors, Zork
  III: The Dungeon Master is a text adventure game. You read descriptions of
  rooms and then interact with the game by typing commands. As all early Zork
  games, it is very easy to get stuck in the game, so you'll have to reload
  several times in order to find the correct way."
