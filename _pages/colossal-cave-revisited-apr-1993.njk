description: Colossal Cave Revisited is a text game developed with TADS (Text
  Adventure Development System). It is a remake of the first major adventure
  game Colossal Cave,  known as Adventure. The original Adventure had only a
  simple two-word command parser. This aspect of the game has been adapted to
  the modern standards. Descriptions of the locations were expanded and in a
  number of places the author wrote entirely new text. The action takes place
  mostly in a cavern, modeled after a real cave called Colossal Cave, part of
  Kentucky's Mammoth Caverns. The adventure begins in a forest next to a small
  brick building, with a gleaming white tower in the distance.
