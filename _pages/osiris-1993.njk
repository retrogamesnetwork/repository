description: Osiris is a puzzle game for three participants. The game field is a
  pyramid which in itself is divided into triangle-shaped fields. Each player
  has a number of blocks in one corner with the goal to reach the middle of the
  pyramid, representing a treasure tomb. Each turn, a player can move one of the
  stones up to four fields. However, each stone has a limit of available moves
  and after that it becomes immobile. A stone can be removed from the field it
  is surrounded by two (or three if it is immobile) hostile stones. The winning
  condition is to get the most points. While removing enemy stones give points,
  the real deal is in the treasure tomb. When a player reaches it with a stone,
  he is out of the game while the others try to remove the stone in question. If
  it is still there after three rounds, many points are awarded. The game
  features both a multiplayer and a single-player mode. When playing alone, the
  player has to win 99 fields which increasing difficulty. This is not only
  reached by making the opponents stronger, but by adding obstacles onto the
  playing field like bombs or already immobile stones.
