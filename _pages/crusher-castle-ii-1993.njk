description: Crusher Castle II is an action game where a character needs to
  escape a haunted castle by eliminating ghosts and picking up tools and
  treasure. The game is a follow-up on a previous version called Crusher by the
  same company. There are 25 rooms are arranged in a 5x5 square, with the
  character starting the game in the center. When you have reached a set score
  of 10.000 points, an extra life is provided and some information to help you
  escape the castle. The gameplay is a mix of Soko-ban and Pac-Man in that there
  are a number of ghosts hunting the character in each room, and they are
  blocked by pushing boxes in their way. If the ghosts catch up, a life is lost.
  Each step made, uses up a bit of the candles needed to survive, and crossing
  into another room uses a large amount of the candle. You cannot pull the
  boxes, but instead you have explosives to destroy them, if you find yourself
  boxed in. There are point rewards for trapping the ghosts, plus you gain
  candles when they disappear. In each room are also gold coins, i.e. extra
  points, and closets that hold a variety of things, both good items and bad,
  some are useless, and some lead to other rooms. Registering the game is
  required to enable the save-game function, otherwise you must restart after
  you run out of lives or candles.
