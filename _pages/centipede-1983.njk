description: "An unlicensed IBM PC translation of the arcade hit - created
  around the same time as Atarisoft's official PC port.  Accordingly, the player
  controls a gun which can be moved throughout the bottom of a mushroom-littered
  playfield, and must curb the attacks of assorted pests: the centipede, which
  traces a path between the mushroom and may be split into segments; the spider,
  which devours both mushrooms and the player; the flea, which deposits new
  mushrooms in its wake; and the scorpion which poisons the mushrooms, sending
  the centipede links into free-fall on contact. One or two players may
  participate, and the selectable skill level adjusts the speed of the game."
