description: "Asteroid Pilot puts you at the helm of a rocket ship, and your
  task is to plot a safe course across the asteroid field.  Your rocket moves to
  the right at a fixed speed, and is constantly pulled down by gravity: your
  only control is the Shift key, which applies upwards thrust. Each asteroid
  field has a randomly chosen difficulty level, which determines the amount of
  asteroids (and space dust) you'll have to dodge.  Crash into a floating space
  rock, and you're history; hitting a dust particle will just reduce your
  maneuverability, but you can restore it back to normal if you bump into
  another one."
