description: Evasive Maneuvers is a single player side-scrolling shareware game
  similar in style to Defender. The player has control of a spaceship which must
  move left to right across the screen which is moving right to left. The
  spaceship needs fuel. This is obtained by shooting fuel supplies this enabling
  the ship to fly longer and extending the game. There are missiles, mines and
  other obstacles to be avoided and these too can be shot to gain points. When
  all lives have been used up the player may get a chance to enter their name on
  the high score table. The game can be controlled via keyboard, joystick or
  mouse. Level / Scenario 1 "Imperial City" was released as shareware with three
  other levels "Infrastructure",  "E.N.I.A.C. 9", and "Desert Valley" making up
  the full registered version.
