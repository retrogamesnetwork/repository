description: A role-playing adventure set in the "future" as seen by Victorian
  era science fiction writers.  Players explore the far corners of the Earth
  (Atlantis, King Tut's tomb etc...) and travel between planets on ships made of
  martian "liftwood" (invented by none other than Thomas Edison).  Based on
  GDW's pencil and paper roleplaying game.  Similar in design to Paragon's
  MegaTraveller series.
