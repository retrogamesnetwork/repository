description: A Journey Into Xanth takes place in the magical world of Xanth
  known from the books of Piers Anthony. The game is a classic
  interactive-fiction game, with a text parser as the sole user interface. It
  was developed using a contemporary toolkit (Adventure Game Toolkit v1.3). You
  are playing a young man named Mim. Like all inhabitants of Xanth, Mim has a
  unique magical ability, the so-called talent. In his case he is able to
  conjure a magical mirror which can then be used to talk to any person he wants
  to, regardless of distance to that person. His talent makes him a quite
  important member of his local community, the Gap village. He serves as the
  villages' liaison to King Trent the ruler of the lands of Xanth, who resides
  in castle Roogna. Mim regularly corresponds with the King discussing various
  matters. This serves as the starting point for your adventure, as the latest
  communication with the King will result into a mission given to Mim.
