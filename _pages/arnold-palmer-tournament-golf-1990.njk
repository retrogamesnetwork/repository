description: Select your level of play, and then head for the pro shop to choose
  between Black Carbon, Glass Fiber, and Ceramic Clubs. Tee off by yourself or
  play 18 holes with a friend. Besides the One and Two Player modes there's also
  a practice mode, match play (head to head), and a full-blown international
  tournament, where you'll stroke it out against 15 competitors. Tournament play
  lasts 12 rounds, 18 holes of golf each. Most rounds are standard "stroke" play
  but the seventh and eighth rounds are "match" games. Things really get serious
  when match game ends in a tie, and players move into a sudden death play-off.
  During the tournament players earn higher skill levels, more knowledgeable
  caddies, and more power. You'll earn a password at the end of each round of
  the tournament. The game let's you play on three different courses; Japan, the
  United States, and Great Britain.
