description: NFL Football is an action oriented game based on the popular sport.
  It is played in real-time so you have to think and act fast. In comparison to
  other arcade sports simulations, there are relative many coaching options. It
  is officially licensed by the NFL and you can choose between about 30 teams.
  Playing modes are preseason matches, practice and a full season. Because there
  are only 30 teams a season is not very long.
