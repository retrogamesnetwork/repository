description: "Karkoth's Keep is a dungeon-crawler set in a fantasy realm, whose
  royal House of Quilan was extinguished generations ago by the undead witch
  king Karkoth.  You, a descendant of the noble dynasty, set out into the
  dungeon under Krakoth's keep in search of the magical sword Ramdahl, with
  which the evil usurper can be defeated. Attributes are determined by random
  rolls, and bestow bonuses or penalties along with the choice of race (Greyelf,
  Dwarf, Human, Halfelf or Highelf) and profession (Ranger, Fighter, Cleric,
  Magic-User, Gedi, or Monk) - not all of which may be combined.  The adventure
  starts in the town of Nosar, your base of operations; it boasts hotels, shops,
  taverns and a hospital for all your basic CRPG needs.  The way to the Keep
  must be divined by communicating with the townsfolk. In the Keep's dungeon,
  only your current line-of-sight is visible; oddities like hidden teleports
  make the journey less than linear.  The rumored Endless Staircase connects all
  ten dungeon levels, with the coveted sword hidden somewhere in the deepest
  four.  En route, the randomly-encountered monsters will do their best to make
  the seeker's life unpleasant (and short) - fortunately, battle and exploration
  reward you with treasure, which takes many forms: valuables, weapons, magical
  items, and other opportunities for good or bad luck.  Spells (for characters
  that can use them) and magical scrolls provide further assistance, and food
  must not be forgotten either. Character development follows the standard
  practice of automatic levelling through experience points gained in combat,
  though you may also trade gold for them when you go in/out of the
  dungeon.  Getting your character killed will have the nasty effect of erasing
  its file from the game disk."
