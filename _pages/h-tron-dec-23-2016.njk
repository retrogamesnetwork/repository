description: H-Tron is a traditional light-cycle game written in Turbo C, and
  aimed at IBM PCs and clones with monochrome (Hercules-compatible)
  graphics.  Each of the two contestants can be controlled by either a human or
  the computer - a machine-vs.-machine demo mode is available too. As always,
  the formula involves two TRON-style light-cycles that leave deadly trails in
  their wake, trying to encircle and trap each other.  Crashing into such a
  trail (or into the arena walls) spells death for the hapless cyclist, and
  earns a point for the opponent.  The first player to win five rounds is the
  victor.
