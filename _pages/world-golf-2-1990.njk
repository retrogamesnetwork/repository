description: World Golf 2 lets you test your skills on the green in a standard
  18-hole round of golf.  Shots are taken from a first-person view of the
  course, in the general direction of the current hole and its flagstick; you
  pack four clubs in your bag (driver, 8 iron, 4 iron, and putter) to give the
  ball the desired loft and distance.  Each shot is further influenced by the
  current wind direction and speed, by the force of your stroke - determined by
  the power bar - and by a margin of error which will skew the shot (depending
  on the position of the left-side slider as you hit the button). The three
  difficulty settings decide just how much these factors affect your
  strokes.  You can also pick a time of day for each game, although this only
  affects the visuals.  Like other games from the same author, this one is
  written for the Tandy 1000 series and requires the respective BASIC
  interpreter.
