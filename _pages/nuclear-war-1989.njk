description: In Nuclear War you have to blow the opposition to smithereens - you
  have four opposing factions. You can either drop the bomb on them using a
  bomber, fire a missile, or try to lure their population using propaganda.
  Ocassionally a random event occurs, for example aliens would land on one of
  the factions and the population suddenly grows, or someone throws cows at the
  opposition, causing a major stampede and killing millions.
