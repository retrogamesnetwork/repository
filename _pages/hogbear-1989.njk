description: In its dark mansion the Hogbear awaits its next victim. Guarded by
  a Vampire, an Ogre, and various other creatures, the player will have to roam
  the many rooms of the estate and hope to escape with your life. Hopefully you
  can locate some weapons and use them in fighting these guarding monsters and
  ultimately Hogbear itself. Hogbear is an updated version of Castle Adventure
  wherein the game uses part graphic and part text commands to explore, loot and
  battle in order to escape from the castle. The game, though graphical, uses a
  lot of ASCII to visualize its graphics. The tone of the game is humorous but
  with a mean streak personified through the narrative which seems to have been
  written by the game's antagonist Hogbear himself. Combating the monsters
  involves moving into them with a selected weapon ranging from bladed weapons
  to dead chickens. This precursor to what is now labeled "survival horror"
  games has graphics (though marketed as an update of Castle Adventure, has
  little graphical difference from that game except for the use of colour) but
  needs text input for commands. Thankfully moving utilizes the cursor keys
  meaning the player can literally move themselves around the rooms and from
  room to room. In order to interact with objects such as picking them up you
  will need to be in close proximity.
