description: In 3 Card High Low Poker, the dealer chooses, on each round,
  whether the winning hand must be high or low, and each of eight players is
  dealt three cards. If the dealer chose high, the best hand wins (and the ace
  is counted high). If the dealer chose low, then the worst hand wins (and the
  ace is counted low). Each player, in turn, can choose to be either 'in' or
  'out' for the round, after the cards are dealt. The only bet is a 25 cent
  ante, and the losers pay the entire pot. So, if at least one player (other
  than the dealer) is 'in' for a round, then each of the losers pays 2 dollars
  to the winner, and the players who were 'out' pay nothing.. If no one but the
  dealer is 'in' for the round, every player pays the dealer 25 cents. The goal
  of the game, as with any gambling game, is simply to win money. The game does
  not end until the player chooses to stop.
