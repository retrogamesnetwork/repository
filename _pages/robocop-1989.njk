description: "Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, Patrolman Alex Murphy
  was killed on the streets of Detroit. The major corporation there, Omni
  Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law
  enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy,
  encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's
  up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one
  responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence
  might not be the kingpin of this town... Ocean's version of RoboCop for 8-bit
  machines loosely adapts the Data East arcade game, with stages inspired by
  those from the coin-op, but also entirely new gameplay elements. In most
  levels, RoboCop walks from left to right, shooting his gun at hordes of
  enemies that intend to kill him with bullets, chainsaws or their fists. Stages
  include the streets of Detroit (in two parts, based on the first level of the
  arcade), a drug factory (based on the fourth arcade level), and a junkyard
  (based on the third coin-op stage). Gun power-ups to collect include a rapid
  fire model, a three-way shot and a powerful flame cannon. Two levels end with
  boss fights against RoboCop's chief adversary ED-209. For some reason, ED is
  impervious to bullets and must be defeated using Robo's fists alone. New
  challenges from the arcade include hostage scenarios: in these, seen from a
  first-person perspective, a criminal holds an innocent person. Moving
  crosshairs and firing precisely, RoboCop must take care to shoot only the
  criminal, not the civilian. Another new game element requires some quick
  thinking: in a puzzle mode, a composite sketch of a suspect is presented and
  must be matched by choosing the correct parts (hair, chin, eyes, etc.) of the
  face within a tight time limit."
