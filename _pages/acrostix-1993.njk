description: Acrostix is a single-player, freeware, word puzzle game that is a
  bit like the word puzzle bit in 'Wheel of Fortune'. The player is presented
  with a short phrase, statement or question which is a clue to a phrase,
  saying, person's name, place, thing etc. The top half of the game area has the
  words in the answer with the letters blacked out and the lower half has a set
  of letters for the player to choose from. The objective is to transfer letters
  from the lower part of the screen to the upper part completing the answer
  correctly. This game is freeware and comes with just twenty puzzles, however
  it includes puzzle creation tools and players uploaded their creations to The
  Knowledge Transfer BBS, which in 2014 no longer exists, and downloaded those
  from other players. The game can be played with the mouse or the keyboard. It
  has a cheat mode which places one correct letter at a time, and an auto solve
  mode which will slowly complete the puzzle automatically unless the player
  cancels it.
