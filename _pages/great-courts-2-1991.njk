description: Great Courts 2 is a tennis game and the sequel to Great Courts. You
  start the game by creating a player and distributing character points, for
  instance on speed, forehand, backhand etc. The initial skills are raised after
  winning a few matches. There are different tournaments to choose from, such as
  all APT tournaments and the Davis Cup. Prize money is provided by doing well
  in a tournament. The game supports both single and double matches. In the
  training mode you can play against a ball machine or against a friend. There
  are different settings to program the ball machine, for instance to practice a
  certain type of shot. It is also possible to have matches with one player
  competing against two.
