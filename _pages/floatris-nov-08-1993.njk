  Floatris is a Tetris clone. Instead of playing one game at a time, the player
  plays eight games simultaneously. And instead of blocks falling down, the
  blocks float upwards. There are also a couple of new shapes for the blocks.

  When a playing field is full, the player can continue to play with the remaining playing fields, until all eight playing fields are full and then the game is over.
