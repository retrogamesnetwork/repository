description: "Fun School 2: For the Under-6s is an educational game part of the
  Fun School series with this version aimed at the under sixes. Parents can
  choose a difficulty level for each game and also enter their own words to use.
  There are eight activities for a child to play and these consist of: Shape
  Snap: Two shapes appear and the child must say whether the shapes are the same
  or not. Teddy Count: A certain amount of Teddies move about the screen and the
  child must say how many are on the screen. Find the Mole: There are five mole
  hills and the child selects one. If the child is wrong then the computer will
  say if the actual number is bigger or smaller. Write a Letter: Here the child
  can move the teddy about the screen and type any letter and can also type
  words. Colour Train: A coloured train moves along the rails and the child has
  to stop it at the matching coloured station to drop off and pick up
  passengers. The train changes colour once it starts moving again. Spell a
  Word: A picture of an object appears and the child must type in the word. Pick
  a Letter: A letter is on screen and the child must move a Teddy over the
  alphabet and select the matching letter and move it into a box. Teddy Bear
  Picnic: The child must move a teddy through a maze to reach a picnic."
