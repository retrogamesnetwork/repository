description: Hypercycles is a single-player, shareware, first-person action game
  with a plot that is reminiscent of the film Tron. The evil Dr. Devaro controls
  a place known as 'The Grid', he lures users into this realm to play his
  malicious games. In these games the player must ride their hypercycle and pit
  themselves against the doctor's legions of riders. In each maze-like arena
  there are rings that must be collected, these are the keys that will open the
  door to the next level. There are also missiles and other power-ups. The game
  has music, sound effects and is entirely keyboard controlled. The full game
  has thirty levels.
