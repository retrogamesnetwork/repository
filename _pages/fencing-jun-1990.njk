description: Fencing is a shareware strategy game for one or two players. The
  game is played on a game area consisting of one hundred and one parallel
  horizontal lines, numbered from AA to EA, and seventy one vertical lines,
  numbered 01 - 71. Players take turns to specify sets of co-ordinates, the
  objective of the game being to create triangles, the winner of the game being
  the player who has enclosed the greatest area at the end of the game. The
  computer opponent has five difficulty settings, there is a save/load function
  and optional sound effects. The game has a countdown timer which the player(s)
  can adjust for shorter or longer games.
