description: "A biblical game based on the chronicles of David, and his rise
  from lowly shepherd boy to the throne of the Kingdom of Israel.  The storyline
  is divided into chapters, covering different episodes of the future monarch's
  life: rescuing sheep from marauding beasts, fighting a duel with the
  Philistine champion Goliath, escaping a plot on his life by King Saul, proving
  his good intentions to the King, daringly sneaking into the camp and taking
  refuge in the hills, and finally saving his family from Amalekite captivity.
  These levels must be completed in order, and each one is staged as an action
  sequence with its own challenges to overcome; if David \"loses all heart\"
  (that is, his health - represented by heart icons), he fails the mission and
  must start over. To avoid coming off as mere fun and entertainment, each level
  is followed by a quiz, where multiple-choice questions test the player's
  biblical knowledge for bonus points."
