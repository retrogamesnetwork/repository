description: The Treehouse is an educational title that is set in the location
  of a children's treehouse. This game teaches toddlers numbers, shapes, letters
  as well as having a special focus on learning about animals, through various
  activities associated with items located throughout the treehouse. Clicking on
  any item in the treehouse will start an activity, or, at least begin an
  animation. The game is the second in what became a trilogy of games including
  the first game The Playroom and finished with the third title, The Backyard.
