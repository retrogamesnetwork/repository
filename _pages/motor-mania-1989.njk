description: Motor Mania is a shareware motorcycle game in which the object is
  to race through a series of jumps in a limited amount of time. Not only is
  time a critical factor, the player must manage their engine to avoid
  overheating, for example by not using the turbo charger when in the air so
  that it has time to cool. The game is both keyboard and joystick controlled
  and has options to play with a colour or monochrome monitor. There is a high
  score screen, the keyboard action keys can be redefined but there is no sound.
  In the registered version is a track designer function
