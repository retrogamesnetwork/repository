description: "This strategy game is played on a 8x8 board, which starts out
  populated with a specific pattern of pieces.  There is always one human player
  against the computer: you control the blue pieces, based around the center of
  the board; the computer player (\"Max\") commands the red ones, arranged along
  the corners.  Each side makes one move per turn (moving a single piece to any
  adjoining square), and the objective is to eliminate the opponent's pieces. To
  do this, pieces may be captured by jumping over them (like checkers, but in
  any direction); or \"infected\" when the other side places its own piece in a
  neighboring square, which causes the victim's pieces to change their color to
  that of the infecting piece.  However, each side does this differently - your
  blue pieces infect the four squares along the vertical/horizontal edges, while
  Max's red pieces infect diagonally along the four corners.  Either method
  awards points, although the score does not determine the winner."
