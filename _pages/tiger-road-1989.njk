description: Tiger Road is a  beat 'em up in which you (as Lee Wong) must rescue
  the village children from the evil Ryo Ken Oh. Many levels are horizontally
  scrolling, although with high ledges to jump onto and follow for a slightly
  different path. Magic urns containing improved weapons appear frequently. Most
  enemies are easy to attack and only need one hit to kill, although they come
  at you in large hordes. Once you get to the indoor sections you will find big
  enemies with the ability to kill you with one hit, in sections set on multiple
  levels complete with stairways.
