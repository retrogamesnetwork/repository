description: Rebound is a basic Breakout clone in 1.8 KB of machine code.  As
  would be expected, the goal is to tear down a wall brick-by-brick by bouncing
  a ball off a paddle that can slide left or right along the bottom of the
  screen.  Pull it off without losing your seven balls, and you win.
