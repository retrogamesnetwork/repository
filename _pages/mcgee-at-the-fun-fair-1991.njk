description: McGee at the Fun Fair is the third game in the McGee series. Like
  the previous two games it is an educational game for young children that is
  entirely wordless so that it can be played by the child alone without any help
  from a parent. The gameplay is identical to the previous games but this time
  McGee has travelled to a fun fair and along with him comes a friend called
  Tony. The fair consists of a few different locations and for each there are
  four icons to click on that cause the two characters to interact with the
  environment in different ways. This includes watching the various entertainers
  (a clown, a juggler and a one man band for instance), having fun on the
  playground and eating ice cream. The game does not have an end sequence so the
  player can explore the locations freely for any length of time.
