description: The Davis Cup is tennis' equivalent of soccer's World Cup - a
  competition between teams of men in their sport representing their
  countries.  16 countries qualify for the tournament and you can choose from
  among 48 players - all with different attributes and skills.  Locations for
  the matches vary from each of the 16 countries including the U.S., Sweden and
  Italy.  The courts also vary between grass, clay, concrete and wood and the
  ball will react differently on each. You can take to the practice court first
  to perfect your serves, lobs, smashes and volleys.  Then you can have a quick
  singles match against a random opponent, have a doubles match with a friend or
  even play a 4-player game using multitap.  There's also the option of playing
  a "winner moves on" series of games, play in a league, or join the Davis Cup
  tournament.
