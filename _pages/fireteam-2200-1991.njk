description: Fireteam 2200 is a tactical wargame set in the 23rd century. You
  take the role of the leader of a taskforce (or "Fireteam") tasked with
  undergoing a series of missions. As with most war games you get to assemble
  your crew and select your scenario, while the action itself takes place in a
  top-down map from which you view your deployed units and issue orders such as
  movement commands, weapon assignations and, of course, who to fire at. You can
  build a squadron of up to 16 units starting with a base budget that allows you
  to choose from 30 different combat units and 25 different weapon types.
  Features modem head-to-head multiplayer gameplay for up to two players across
  platforms (meaning an Amiga player can show a DOS player how it's done).
