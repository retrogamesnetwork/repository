description: "A simple tactical combat simulation for two players, set upon a
  hex grid map.  The conflict takes place in the Cold War, with six Soviet Red
  Army units on the offensive against a triad of cities, defended by four US
  Army units. Obeying certain rules, e.g. according to the type of terrain and
  the placement of enemy units, each side gets a movement phase and an attack
  phase per game turn.  Combat will either eliminate one of the sides or force
  it to retreat; cities and woods provide a defense bonus.  Both sides must meet
  their respective goals within 10 game turns: the Soviets win if they can
  occupy and hold at least two of the cities; otherwise, victory goes to the
  Americans.  PCjr Cartridge BASIC is required to run the game."
