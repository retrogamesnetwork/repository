description: Eight man-years of development resulted in this detailed recreation
  of golf, endorsed by one of the great players of the 1980s. Two courses are
  included, with 3D modeling of the effects of ball lie and swing style. You can
  disable ball effects to make it more straightforward, and weather and wind
  effects are optional. Match play and stroke play are included, as are
  Fourball, Foursome and Greensome modes for 4 players in 2 teams of two, as
  well as a practice mode. The game is played from a 3D perspective, with an
  overhead view before each shot.
