description: "AGI Tetris, not to be confused with the 1998 game of the same
  name, is a Tetris variant which was programmed with Sierra 's Adventure Game
  Interpreter engine. The basic playing principle follows the standard by the
  book: blocks of varying forms fall down from the top of the screen. The player
  is able to rotate them and as soon as they hit the ground, they become
  stationary and the next piece (which is shown in a preview field) falls down.
  The goal is to create complete lines which then are removed from the
  playfield. The game is lost when the stack reaches the top. Each level (before
  starting the game, the player can set the beginning level between one and
  five) requires to clear a certain amount of lines. Then the screen is wiped
  and the next level begins. Those levels progress in difficulty and introduce a
  higher falling speed or pre-arranged blocks which hinder the player's ability
  to create lines. There is no reward for clearing multiple lines at once (no
  high-score) and the background images are taken from Sierra's AGI adventures."
