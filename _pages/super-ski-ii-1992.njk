description: In the sequel to Super Ski, six ski events are available - Super
  Giant, Bobsleigh, Slalom, Ski Jump, Moguls, and Downhill. Set in famous
  resorts of French Alps  such as Val-d'Is√®re, Courchevel, or La Tania, ski
  events may be practiced in Training mode, or taken on in a sequence of 2 of
  each in Competition mode. Almost all events show the player from behind,
  except Moguls, where screen is scrolling down with players` progress, and Ski
  Jump, where player should come to camera from the far view. Player should
  avoid obstacles, stay on a route, and pass the gates in Slalom-like events;
  stay on the route in Bobsleigh, finish in first place with more style and
  jumps in Moguls, and jump good in Ski Jump. 1-2 players mode is available.
