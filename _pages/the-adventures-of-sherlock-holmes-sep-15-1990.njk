description: 'A good example of the difference a little multimedia can do, the
  Adventures of Sherlock Holmes plays like a textmode proof-of-concept of the
  better-known Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective.  The basic investigative
  elements remain the same: managing time dashing to various locations around
  Olde London Towne in search of clues, but here instead of successfully
  receiving them as video clips you often get cryptic encoded messages in
  "fill-in-the-blank" form, intended in total to spell out, some directly and
  some through phonetic wordplay, the name of the killer, the method they used,
  and their motive for committing the crime.  Characters from the original tales
  including Dr. Watson, Mrs. Baker and Inspector Lestrade help to establish the
  flavour of literary canon as you investigate all-new crimes (some
  user-contributed!)'
