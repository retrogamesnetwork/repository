description: Icarus is (despite the number in its title) the third installment
  in the Korean-made series of horizontally scrolling sci-fi shoot-em-ups. Once
  again, Captain Lee and his friends must stop an army of mechanized creatures
  from destroying Earth. Power-ups either change the weapon's properties or
  enhance the current weapon by extending the shot, adding three-way fire, etc.
  Picking a different weapon, however, reverts to its default weak form. The
  player has a choice between two pilots, but their ships differ only in their
  default weapon. For the first time in the series, there is a two-player co-op
  mode. The two spaceships, controlled simultaneously, can be combined to form a
  giant mecha.
