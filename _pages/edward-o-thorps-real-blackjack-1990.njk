description: A simple but entertaining casino game of 'Blackjack'. The game
  bears the name of Dr. Edward O. Thorp, who is famous for his work on 'winning
  strategy' and statistics tables for the game of Twenty One, and those are the
  tables used and displayed in the game itself. Up to six players can compete
  against the dealer - the options section provide flexible 'house rules', and
  extensive in-game help alongside with the optional Tutor could make Blackjack
  experience enjoyable even for the beginners.
