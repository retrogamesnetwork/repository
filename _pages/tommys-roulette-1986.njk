description: Tommy's Roulette is a single-player, shareware roulette game. The
  player can only place a limited set of the standard roulette bets, up to six
  individual numbers, odd, even, high, low or one of the 'dozens'. There are no
  pairs, groups of three, four or six, no neighbours, no red or black. They
  start with $100 and can continue playing even when they run out of money. The
  cumulative score is saved in a work-file which can be erased thus resetting
  the player's cash score back to $100. As with all of Tommy's games it uses
  character graphics and is entirely keyboard controlled. It has basic sound
  effects and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and
  to force either a colour or monochrome display
