description: "Caleb was once a feared gunslinger, until he met a woman who was
  involved with a mysterious cult known as Cabal. Caleb, too, is sucked in, and
  soon becomes one of the Chosen - the most favored worshippers of the evil god
  Tchernobog. But one day, Tchernobog inexplicably kills the four Chosen,
  including Caleb. Mysteriously resurrected years later, Caleb is out to get
  revenge, and learn why his lord cast him down so abruptly. Blood is a
  first-person shooter with horror elements, which uses the Build engine.
  Similarly to Duke Nukem 3D, the environment is interactive: many objects can
  be physically moved or affected in other ways. Destruction of landscapes is
  possible (although only in specific spots), with bullet holes being left by
  misplaced shots. The Build engine version is 2.5D, so there are rooms above
  rooms and puzzles which are based on this. The game consists of four episodes,
  each containing a set of maps that have to be traversed by the protagonist in
  a specific order. The levels are usually realistic-looking structures, e.g. a
  carnival complete with twisted attractions, a city district, a moving train,
  etc. Throughout the levels, Caleb will have to find keys (up to six in a
  level) and hit switches in order to work his way to the exit. On the way, he
  will meet a variety of enemies, such as zombies that tend to come back to life
  after killed, cultists armed with shotguns and tommy guns that shout in
  pseudo-Latin language, crawling hands that attempt to choke him, hell-hounds
  that can set him on fire with their breath, and many more. Boss battles await
  Caleb at the end of each episode. To defend himself against this menace, Caleb
  utilizes a variety of weapons: a pitchfork; a flare gun that can set enemies
  on fire; a sawed-off shotgun; a tommy gun; a napalm launcher; TNT bundles
  which come in three different varieties; a home-made flamethrower made of an
  aerosol can; a tesla cannon that electrocutes enemies; a magical staff dubbed
  \"Life Leech\"; and a voodoo doll. There are items to pick up strewn around.
  Unlike most other 3D shooters, the protagonist's health is not replenished via
  medikits, but by \"Life Essences\", heart-like power-ups randomly dropped by
  enemies upon their death. It is also possible to find armor, which comes in
  three different varieties - Physical, Fire, and Spiritual, each one defending
  Caleb from different attacks. There are also other power-ups: some (such as
  Jumping Shoes or Doctor's Bag) can be picked up and activated at any time,
  while others (such as Partial Invisibility) activate immediately when taken.
  As the title implies, violent and gory imagery plays a significant role in the
  game. Enemies might explode when taken out; it is possible to kick severed
  heads; impaled victims can be found lying around; enemies die in different
  ways depending on how they are attacked and in which part of their body, etc."
