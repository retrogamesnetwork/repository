description: Buddyros is a logical game with simple rules. The game combines
  elements of Boulder Dash, Dyna Blaster and Sokoban. The goal is to collect all
  the keys from the board and get through to the exit door to the next level
  without getting killed. At each level (of which there are around fifty, but
  the built-in editor lets players create more) the player character may expect
  stones to crush him, antigravity and levitating stones, bombs, dynamite
  sticks, walls, wagging hammers and even sponges.
