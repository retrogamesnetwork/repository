description: In Mice Men, two players compete in order to see which can be the
  first to get all of their 12 mice to the other side of the 19 by 13 board of
  cheese blocks. The board is randomized at the start of a game, but the blue
  mice are always placed in the first nine columns from the left and the red
  mice in the first nine columns from the right. The player which gets the first
  move is also decided randomly. Gameplay consists of each player taking turns
  moving one column up or down by one unit. The columns wrap around, so moving
  one down will place what used to be at the bottom at the top, and moving one
  up will do the reverse. After a move, all the player's mice that no longer
  have their path blocked will move forward as far as they can, then any of the
  opponent's mice that can now also move will do so as well. Players can only
  move columns on which they have at least one mouse. In addition, a player will
  be unable to move a column even if they have at least one mouse on it if the
  opponent had just moved that same column or if, in their previous turn, they
  had moved it for the sixth time in a row. These limits do not apply if the
  player has all remaining mice on the same column. In case each player has only
  one mouse remaining, a turn limit applies, the game ending no more than eight
  turns later even if neither managed to get their sole remaining mouse to the
  other side of the board. In this situation, the player whose mouse is further
  along will be declared the winner. If both mice are equally close to their
  goal at that moment, the game is considered a draw. In the shareware version,
  the game can only be played against the computer, which will always play with
  the red mice. In the registered version, two human players can also play
  against each other.
