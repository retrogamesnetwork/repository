description: Jackson City is a vertically scrolling space shoot'em-up game. The
  player, as spaceship pilot, must fight along the game levels versus hordes of
  aliens and (quite surrealistic) fruits. Also, there are, along the levels,
  power-ups that improve the firepower, the speed of the player's spaceship or
  the amount of fuel. At the end of each level there is a final boss that must
  be defeated.
