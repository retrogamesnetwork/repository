description: Hangman is a word-guessing game based on the original paper and
  pencil version played by at least two players. The game shows you a series of
  blank spaces. You have a certain number of guesses; every time you guess
  wrong, a drawing of a hanged man will keep being drawn until a certain amount
  of mistakes are made. Once you lose, the drawing will be finished and the
  hanged man will literally be a hangman. This version of the game comes with
  two different word lists (Basic and Advanced) and also allows you to create up
  to six different word lists with whatever words you choose. It will also show
  you a hint if you press the F1 key, or outright show you the word if you press
  F2 (but that's cheating, so please don't do it.)
