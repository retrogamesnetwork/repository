description: Overlord is a real-time strategic warfare game where the player
  must manage large standing armies, economic capital, and political stability
  throughout a number of extra-dimensional star systems. As the dictatorial
  ruler of the Epsilon Galaxy, the player has obtained complete, indisputable
  authority. However, during a scientific experiment in hyperdrive technology,
  Epsilon scientists discovered four "buffer" dimensions, each containing a
  number of barren planets that exist between the Epsilon Galaxy and another
  alien dimension. Unfortunately, the most powerful empires from these alternate
  dimensions have also just discovered these zones through their own
  experiments. The player must battle these alien species for control of these
  buffer worlds, to ensure that their rule in the Epsilon Galaxy remains intact.
  To make the new planets useful in the player's campaign, they can purchase
  terraforming equipment which can transform them into tropical Gaian-esque
  worlds which are ideal for agriculture, mineral-rich and heavily volcanic
  worlds, desert planets capable of producing vast amounts of energy, or
  ecologically balanced planets that can support large cities which are readily
  able to generate significant income through taxation. In addition, the player
  can mine for resources and tax their citizens to raise money, construct
  spaceship-buildings to feed the populace, enlist soldiers and equip them, buy
  battle cruisers or other craft to move from planet to planet, and so on. The
  player can fight battles, colonize planets, and even spy on alien races. The
  end goal is to ensure that the other alien races do not gain the upper hand by
  conquering these four new dimensions before the player can. The player cannot
  retreat from battle, as the only way to shut down the hyperspace link from
  their universe to Epsilon would be by vaporizing the player's homeworld, which
  is where the hyperspace generator is located. Politically (at the very least),
  this is not an option. Blood will have to be shed for supremacy of the
  hyperspace planets, and for the player to become Overlord of these four new
  dimensions plus their own.
