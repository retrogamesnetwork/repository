description: Carl Lewis' Go for the Gold is an action game allowing you to play
  as athlete training for the Olympic decathlon. The player may practice first
  before entering competition, starting in high school, then college, national,
  and eventually world track meets. A full set of rules for each track and field
  event (100m sprint, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400m sprint, 110 metres
  hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, 1500m run) is included, as
  well as contemporary USA and world records, and Carl Lewis' short biography.
  The final challenge is to go against Carl Lewis himself (who provides comments
  and tips to the player throughout the game) .
