description: "Duke Nukem II is a platform game and a sequel to Duke Nukem. While
  giving an interview on TV, the famous muscular hero Duke Nukem is captured by
  the evil Rigelatins, who intend to use his brain for conquering Earth. Duke
  easily escapes his prison cell. Now he has to make his way through four
  episodes, each one consisting of an assortment of levels with varying graphic
  design. On his way, Duke has to destroy lots of obstacles and enemies - both
  Rigelatin forces and apparent local wildlife. Initially, Duke has just a weak
  laser rifle, but he can also find a flamethrower (which allows him to shoot
  down to launch himself in the air), a rocket launcher or a far more powerful
  laser cannon. These stronger weapons, however, have limited ammo. There are
  also lots of items to collect: health items such as soda cans or atom
  power-ups, Duke Nukem merchandise which gives score, keys and access cards
  that let him pass through locked door or electrical barriers. Duke can also
  find a rapid fire power-up which lets him shoot faster, a cloaking device
  which allows him to go through forcefields, and a globe which will give the
  player a hint when brought to a special pedestal. A lot of items are hidden in
  boxes of various colors which have to be opened by shooting. Beware, as some
  boxes do not contain items, but rather a harmful bomb! On some levels, Duke
  can find a small spaceship. He can enter it and fly around the level, using
  the ship's powerful cannon to mow down everything in his way. However, the
  ship won't fit everywhere, so Duke will have to get out of it eventually."
