description: 1,000,000 square miles of open sea, your nuclear powered frigate
  and a fleet of Russian ships circling you. This is the set-up of Frigate a
  strategy battle game taking place near the end of the Cold War. Your mission
  is straight-forward. Destroy as many enemy ships as you can and try not to
  die. Points will be awarded for your evasive skills as your enemies are very
  well armed and for your hunting skills. Luckily your weapons are far stronger
  but there's strength in numbers. At your disposal are the following tools;
  radar, sonar, anti-missile weapons, radio jammers, and of course your
  ordnance. Your view screen shows two main windows with one devoted to our
  ship's status and one command menu where you give orders and receive notes
  about what is happening around you. Information is constantly being updated as
  to your ships defenses and weapons as well as the position of enemies and
  their missiles. The game-play is turn based and you can try and enter as many
  commands as you like in the given time period. As with many simulation games
  there are repercussions to damages you will receive from malfunctioning radars
  to weapon arrays. Graphics are largely non-existent and almost everything
  except for the title screen are text based so making your own written charts
  may aid you in successfully completing your mission.
