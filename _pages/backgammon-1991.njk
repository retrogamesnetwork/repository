description: Backgammon is a single player, shareware, implementation of the
  classic board game. This implementation can be played with keyboard or mouse
  and in either colour of monochrome. The game has three skill levels however
  the shareware release is limited in that it only allows the player to have a
  single game at a time and advanced features such as doubling are not
  implemented. The shareware release was issued in a package along with Kirsta's
  other shareware games Cribbage and Draughts
