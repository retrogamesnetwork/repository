description: Local ants are keen to take your sugar cubes. Fortunately you are
  armed with a fly swatter, which can be used to squash them. Move it around the
  screen and hit each ant before it can drag a cube off the screen. On each
  level you have a target minimum of cubes to protect. There are also levels
  with no cubes - these see the ants moving faster than usual, and you must
  squash as many as possible, with a bonus based on your percentage success. The
  game's sampled sounds are used to give a comic and home-brew feel to
  proceedings.
