description: Shortly after the war, several countries want to control Berlin. An
  atomic bomb has been smuggled into the city by the Americans. You play an
  American spy, whose mission is to guard this bomb and not to let Stalin have
  it under any circumstances. This is one of the early examples of a 3rd person
  perspective point & click adventure, the interface being slightly more
  complicated than the famous SCUMM system.
