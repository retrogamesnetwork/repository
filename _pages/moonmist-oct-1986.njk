description: Tamara Lynd has recently become engaged to Jack Tresyllian, a
  wealthy owner of the Tresyllian Castle in Cornwall, England. Shortly
  afterwards, she began seeing a ghost-like figure, a mysterious White Lady, who
  has allegedly been haunting the castle for centuries. A series of events and
  dark suspicions involving hidden treasure convince Tamara that her life is in
  danger. She contacts a friend of hers, a young American detective, asking him
  to travel to the castle and investigate the mystery. Moonmist is a text
  adventure game. In the beginning the player chooses between four different
  scenarios, represented by the colors red, blue, yellow and green. Each
  scenario has different tasks, a different criminal, and different treasure.
  The game has a built-in clock, and must be completed before 6:00 am in-game
  time, otherwise it ends prematurely. Depending on the player's choice of the
  protagonist's gender, characters may react differently to his or her actions.
