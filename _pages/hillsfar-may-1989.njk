  Play a would-be hero in the city of Hillsfar, where action and adventure await
  the daring adventurer. Join the local guild and complete missions from the
  guild master in a quest for glory and gold! Hillsfar is a single-hero
  role-playing game (in comparison to other Advanced Dungeons & Dragons
  role-playing games, where the player usually controls a group of characters).
  A combination of first person perspective (when traveling in the city of
  Hillsfar) and third person perspective (usually in some action-style
  mini-quests) viewpoints. As a would-be-hero, four classes are available in a
  randomly generated mission-based plot: fighter, thief, cleric, or magic-user.
  Each class to a certain extent, have different assigned quests given by each
  respective guild. In Hillsfar, gameplay usually consists of various mini-games
  that are needed to complete the quests or missions provided at the local guild
  by the guild master. These mini-games (and their viewpoints) include:


  Fighting in the arena (third person).

  Competing at the archery range (first person).

  Exploring buildings or mazes (top-down).

  Riding a horse outside Hillsfar while avoiding obstacles (third person/side-scrolling).

  Locking picking doors and chests (first person).


  Unlike most role-playing games, there aren't any randomly generated monsters to battle. In Hillsfar, combat only occurs in the arena.
