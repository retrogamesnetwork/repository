description: Around the World Trivia is a shareware, or "try before you buy",
  quiz game for up to four players. This is a 'Trivia Shell' game meaning that
  the basic software can be applied to many different subjects by changing the
  load screen and question packs. The game has three levels of difficulty which
  it applies to the same question pack. For example given the question "What sea
  separates Korea from Japan?" on the Beginner setting the player would be given
  the answer and a True/False buttons; on the Intermediate setting the player
  would be given four choices; and on the Advanced setting the player would have
  to type in the complete answer. With multiplayer games it is possible to have
  players on different difficulty settings - useful when parents are playing
  against children for example. The game has a hint feature and a high score
  table that shows the top five scores for each difficulty setting. If the
  player answers five correct questions in a row they are rewarded with a bonus
  question. Games can be configured to be any length, the default is thirty
  questions, and can be restricted to particular topics. There is an optional
  hint feature. The shareware game has just 105 questions while the registered
  games have either three hundred or six hundred questions.
