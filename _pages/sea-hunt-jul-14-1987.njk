description: Sea Hunt is a computerized version of the classic board game,
  "Battleship", for PC-DOS or MS-DOS. The player is pitted against the computer
  A.I.  There is no two-player option. There are ten difficulty levels.  Each
  player's fleet consists of eight ships, compared to the five featured in the
  board game version.  These include an aircraft carrier, battleship, destroyer,
  cruiser, mine sweeper, submarine, spy ship and patrol boat.  Because of the
  larger number of ships, the game also features a larger playing grid which
  measures 15 x 19 squares compared to the standard 10 x 10. Grid squares are
  selected by moving a cursor over the grid, either with the cursor (arrow) keys
  or using a joystick.  There is no mouse support.  When placing ships on the
  player's grid, they can be pivoted so that they are oriented either vertically
  or horizontally using the space bar. The computer A.I. elicits a personality
  of sorts, gloating every time it sinks a ship, and protesting when one of its
  ships is sunk.  This can be turned off by those who find it annoying.
