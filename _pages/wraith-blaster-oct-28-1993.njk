description: "Wraith Blaster is a space trading game with a text adventure
  interface. You begin the game at the start of a career in interplanetary
  trade: you have just purchased your very first spaceship, and you have 200
  space-credits to your name. The aim of the game is to turn that into 30,000
  space-credits, attain the rank of Master Trader, and find a good place to
  settle down and retire. There are a number of specialized commands, explained
  in the instructions, for controlling your ship (such as \"ORBIT', \"DOCK\",
  \"FLEE\") and getting status reports (such as \"CARGO\", \"SENSORS\",
  \"ENERGY\"). The game also uses \"UP\" and \"DOWN\" commands to mean
  teleportation between a planet's surface and orbiting space stations, as in
  \"beaming up\"/\"beaming down\" in Star Trek."
