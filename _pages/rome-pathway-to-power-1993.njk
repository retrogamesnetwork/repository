description: "Rome: Pathway to Power is set - as the name implies - in Ancient
  Rome. You start life as a poor slave in Herculaneum, which, along with
  Pompeii, was destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. Eventually you travel
  to Rome and climb the social ladder, becoming a Captain in the army, a Senator
  and eventually Emperor of Rome. Four of the game's six levels are adventure
  style romps, while in the other two levels you control an army in an attempt
  to conquer an enemy of Rome. The game contains many characteristic details to
  be seen around the levels; from naked people running around the Baths, to
  buying slaves to fight in the Gladiatorial games. There are instances in which
  you have the freedom to choose how to deal with various problems."
