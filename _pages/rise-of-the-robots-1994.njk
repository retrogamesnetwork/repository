description: "Electrocorp, the world's leading manufacturer and developer of
  advanced robotics ran the Leader Project to develop a multi-task,
  ultra-intelligent, self-aware robot to manage every aspect of the factory
  plant. The end result was the Supervisor Droid, a machine capable of assuming
  any form and accessing any database. But when an EGO virus infected the
  Supervisor's self-awareness it started to consider its need above of those of
  the company, infecting the other robots in the plant and declaring itself
  their leader. Electrocorp then sent its top-secret ECO32-5 Cyborg to
  infiltrate the plant and destroy the supervisor. Rise of the Robots is a
  versus fighting game. The player controls the ECO32-5 Cyborg and must fight
  all the other robots in the plant until finally meeting the Supervisor Droid.
  The controls consist of 3 buttons for punches and 3 buttons for kicks (one for
  each in the Game Gear version), and jumping, moving, crouching and blocking
  are performed with the directional pad. The Cyborg has two super moves, the
  Turbo Head Butt and the Shoulder Barge. The player can choose the difficulty,
  number of rounds and time limit for the fights, as well as turn turn the super
  moves off. The game has three modes: mission, where the player fights each
  robot in a fixed order; training, where the player can fight any robot in any
  desired order; and two players versus mode (absent in the Game Gear version),
  where the second player chooses any of the enemy robots to fight with. It
  features an AI system that reacts to the player style, 3D rendered cutscenes
  and the title song was composed by Queen's guitarist Brian May."
