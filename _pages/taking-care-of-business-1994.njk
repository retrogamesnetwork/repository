description: Another game about crates!  Building blocks of sorts, they both
  obstruct the player's path in initial level layouts and yet are required to
  re-assemble into staircase configurations in order to reach the exits of 15
  shareware levels (60 in the registered version).  While the crates don't
  necessarily have set destinations, there is a limited number of valid
  positions for them to occupy and leave the level still solvable, making this
  in some thematic senses a platformer variant of Soko-Ban. But protagonist
  Demolisher Dirk, no doubt rockin' out to Bachman-Turner Overdrive in his
  Walkman, needs to do more than schlep a bunch of boxes around an empty room;
  there are hazards to be avoided (electricity arcs, eek!), switches to flip
  (altering level lay-outs) and a plethora of power-ups allowing him to jump
  higher and bash or blast through certain kinds of pesky wall.
