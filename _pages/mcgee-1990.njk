description: McGee is an educational game for young children (ages 2 to 6). The
  game is entirely wordless and tells its story through graphics and sound
  making it possible for the child to play the game without help from an adult.
  The idea is that the child in this way should become familiar and confident
  with the computer and grow a sense of discovery. In the game the player takes
  control of a child protagonist called McGee and gets to explore his home. The
  house consists of a couple of rooms and in each room there are a few objects
  that can be interacted with. All interaction is done by clicking on the four
  different icons that appear in each room. When doing so a short animation will
  start and McGee will do something, for example play with a ball, take a bath
  or hide under the carpet. There is no specific objective to the game and the
  player can move around freely between the rooms and interact with things over
  and over again.
