description: This is an adventure game in a similar vein to Where in the World
  is Carmen SanDiego, although the questions deal with additional topics besides
  geography (science, weather, history, etc.).  And instead of pursuing a
  variety of henchmen leading-up to Carmen SanDiego, each puzzle is just another
  step towards stopping Dr. Data. The game is based on a book of the same name.
