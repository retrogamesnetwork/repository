description: "It is the ninth century, and Camelot, the legendary castle ruled
  by King Arthur, has fallen under a curse. Famine and drought plague the
  kingdom because of the love triangle between the king, his wife Gwenhyver, and
  the knight Launcelot. It appears that only the mysterious Holy Grail can
  restore Camelot, and three knights - Launcelot, Gawaine, and Galahad - embark
  on a journey to find it, and soon disappear without trace. King Arthur leaves
  his castle in search of the missing knights, hoping to locate the Grail as
  well. His quest takes him to real and mythical locations in England, and later
  to Jerusalem and other areas of the Holy Land. Conquests of Camelot is an
  adventure game that requires the player to input text commands, mostly by
  combining verbs and objects (such as \"look man\", \"take purse\", etc.). A
  few commands (such as \"ask about\") have keyboard shortcuts. Unlike most
  other adventures, the game does not focus extensively on inventory-based
  puzzles. Rather, it presents a diverse array of tasks depending on concrete
  situations. These involve exploration, solving riddles, gathering information,
  participating in arcade sequences such as jousting, and others. Rudimentary
  money management is present as well. Many problems have different solutions,
  and it is possible to reach the final part of the game even without having
  completed some of the essential quests (e.g. failing to save the knights).
  However, Arthur is being judged by the game in three different categories:
  skill (referring to the action sequences), wisdom (evaluating the amount of
  cultural information gathered), and soul (determining the moral value of
  Arthur's action). Failure to achieve a high score in the last category leads
  to a bad ending. The game is set in a concrete historical period, but adds an
  alternate reality to it, assuming that pagan deities really existed, but were
  overshadowed by Christian worship. However, there are only a few references to
  real religious practices of the time or any historical characters."
