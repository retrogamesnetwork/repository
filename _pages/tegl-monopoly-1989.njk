  TEGL Monopoly is a more-or-less faithful shareware recreation of the American
  version of Parker's classic board game. The game is played with the mouse or
  with the keyboard, there is no save-game function and apart from a few beeps
  there's no sound. The game starts with the players deciding on their credit
  limit,  they can have $500, $1000, $2000, $32768 or no credit at all. They
  then select their tokens, this is one point where the game deviates from the
  board game in that the tokens are tiny people of various colours. The players
  then take turns clicking on the dice icon, once to start the dice spinning and
  once to stop them. The little person walks the appropriate number of squares
  and the player buys the property, pays rent, or it's put up for auction.

  For the most part the game is entirely faithful to the board game, indeed the in-game documentation refers the player to Parker's rules in places. However it differs in the following, crucial, areas: Firstly the supply of houses and hotels is inexhaustible Houses and hotels can be built unevenly Property can be traded without having to sell all the houses first

  In the documentation the shareware game refers to itself as the 'The Electronic Monopoly Designer Kit' saying that 'the source code is designed to allow modifications to meet the different playing rules that players have developed'.
