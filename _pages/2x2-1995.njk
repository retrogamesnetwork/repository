description: 2x2 is a game for learning multiplication tables. The game is a
  Tetris variant. The game takes place in the same manner, except that the
  player does not stack bricks but digits. The player's task is to choose the
  correct digit arising from a multiplication operation. If correct, the
  selection is deleted, if not, it remains. After three correct answers in a row
  one incorrect block is removed. The game allows players to configure advanced
  multiplication tables and determine which part of the mathematical equation
  they will complement.
