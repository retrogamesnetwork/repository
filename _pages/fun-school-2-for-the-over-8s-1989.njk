description: "Fun School 2: For the Over-8s is an educational game part of the
  Fun School series with this version aimed at the over eights. Parents can
  choose a difficulty level for each game and also enter their own words to use.
  There are eight activities for a child to play and these consist of: Build a
  Bridge: A square sits underneath a bridge and it must be filled with various
  shapes and placed in the correct position to hold the bridge up. Passage of
  Guardians: The child controls a robot and moves him down various passages and
  attempt to get past the various guardians. When a guardian is touched, it
  reveals a word with the letters mixed up and the child has to type the correct
  word to move past.. Unicorn: A robot has to save an unicorn from a burning
  forest by moving three objects in front of it around a winding path. The robot
  can only carry one object at a time and certain objects cannot be left alone
  with each other while the robot is away.. Logic Doors: A robot needs to move
  around a maze of rooms with various coloured and striped doors by using the
  correct matching keys it finds. The robot can only carry two keys at  a time
  so keys will need to be dropped in order to progress. Souvenirs: The robot
  needs to visit a certain amount of countries in Western Europe and needs to
  buy a souvenir in them as proof with just ¬£30. After choosing a country on the
  map, three souvenirs appear each costing a different amount in the countries
  currency. A exchange rate is provided for each country. Code Boxes: A code
  appears on a box and you have to decipher it to guess how many objects are in
  the box. There are a various amount of boxes to try with the same code
  solution. Mystery Machine: The robot needs to operate the machine in the
  correct sequence but the instructions are in various codes. Once a code is
  worked out for each word the child enters the letters to receive the machine
  operating instructions. Escape: Completing each of the seven activities gives
  the child a keyword and these are needed for a robot to escape from another
  maze of rooms. Only certain doors can be entered and after progressing through
  a certain number, the computer will ask for a keyword. Give the computer all
  seven words and the robot has escaped."
