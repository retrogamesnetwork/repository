description: F-Tetris is a pretty classic Tetris clone for DOS. It includes
  three difficulty levels, high-scores and joypad support. The graphical
  interface is basic, but clean and straightforward. A monochrome mode is also
  available, for very old computers. One notable feature of the game is its
  "Bastard!" game mode, that makes the game avoid providing you with blocks that
  you need the most.
