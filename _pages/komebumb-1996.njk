description: "Komebumb is a platform game with cartoonish characters. In this
  game the player takes the role of a little hairy creature, with a great
  jumping skill, that has one mission: eat all the bombs in each level before
  the time limit reaches zero (there is a limited time to eat each bomb). The
  creature must avoid a lot of traps and enemies in all the levels. To kill the
  enemies the starring must jump on their heads. To increase the amount of
  points the player can kill enemies or collect coins in each level."
