description: As Billy, you set off to rescue Gizmo the Gremlin from Clamp Tower
  skyscraper, where Dr. Catheter plans to viciously experiment with him.
  Unfortunately, Catheter gets word of your plans, and mixes up a whole new
  batch of vicious gremlins. As a result, your mission is now one of destruction
  and avoidance. Elite's implementation of this is a five-level side-view action
  game, in which you run around avoiding or shooting the gremlins. Each level
  has a secret object which must be collected. Bonus items such as extra lives
  and time can be collected, as can improved weapons, and credits to spend on a
  new weapon after each level.
