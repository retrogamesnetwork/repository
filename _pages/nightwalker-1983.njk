description: You are a reporter, who has just been assigned to New Orleans to
  try to crack a heroin smuggling ring known to be operating along the
  waterfront.  Arriving with $500, your goal is to befriend the strange denizens
  of nighttime New Orleans, and try to solve the case. Night Walker is an
  adventure game where you explore a map of the New Orleans waterfront, visiting
  different locations to gather clues.  When the player enters a building, they
  go into text mode, where they can answer yes/no questions to advance the
  story.  They can also make observations, which can be used to query other
  characters at a later date.  There is also an inventory system, and the player
  can bribe characters from their limited funds.  The player can enter all
  buildings only once, and must gather clues during this encounter.  If they
  miss important clues, they can not reenter a building, making it essential to
  visit buildings in the correct order. The TRS-80 version has a 2-dimensional
  map represent the New Orleans waterfront, while the Commodore 64 uses a
  3-dimensional display.  Otherwise there are no differences between gameplay or
  story.
