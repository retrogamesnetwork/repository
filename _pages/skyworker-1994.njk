description: It's the 22nd century. To unburden the situation in the crowded
  cities huge platforms with research facilities, factories and living areas
  have been built in the sky. You play a young man or woman who has just
  finished school and gets the chance to live in SkyCity, one of those
  platforms. But there is one condition. You have to find an apprenticeship
  within three months if you don't want to be sent back to the surface.
  Skyworker is a game by the German Federal Ministry for Economics and Labour
  that simulates the application process for an apprenticeship. In fact,
  Skyworker is a life simulation.     With your teleporter you visit different
  locations in the city like a bar, a casino, drugstores or shops where you can
  buy things and meet people who give you tips about applications or other
  locations in the city. To earn money you can do temporary jobs which are
  presented as a mini-game in which you have to arrange figures by their
  appearance for instance. Within three months you have to find an
  apprenticeship. If you are not sure for what job you want to apply for you can
  go to career counselling. In multiple choice questions they try to find out
  which job suits to you. Afterwards you can go to a training center where you
  can improve your skills. After having created a curriculum vitae you can
  contact enterprises and are invited to an interview in which the boss tries to
  find out if you have appropriate skills and are informed about the content of
  the job you are applying for. The next day you get either a declination or an
  invitation to an aptitude test. The test consists of 14 exercises about
  general education, logical thinking and mathematics. If you pass the test, you
  have the job but the game won't be over yet...
