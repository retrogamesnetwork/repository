description: PC Gol is a very basic soccer simulator which skews the managerial
  simulation component of its direct competitor, the PC F√∫tbol series, and
  focuses just into playing soccer. The player can choose between isolated
  friendly matches against other teams or trying to win the European
  Championship, the World Championship or the America Cup. The gameplay and
  graphics are somewhat reminiscent of Sensible Soccer.
