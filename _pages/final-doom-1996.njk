description: "Final DOOM is the last id Tech 1 DOOM game. It adds two separate
  32 level episodes: TNT: Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment to DOOM II.
  Gameplay in both episodes is completely identical to DOOM II, right down to
  the level progression (i.e. 30 levels and two secret levels), although they
  have a new backstory (both following directly on DOOM II rather than each
  other. Other changes are some new textures and, in TNT 's case a few new music
  tracks. Neither episode was made by id Software, but rather by two groups of
  individuals hired by them; Team TNT and the Casali brothers."
