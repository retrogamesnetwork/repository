description: Iron Assault is a "light" simulator of big robots. As in any other
  mech-sim, game actions take place in a distant future, but in this case on our
  own planet(Earth) at the end of 21st century. Player joins the ranks of
  resistance force to fight back world, enslaved by  global corporations. As
  Mechwarrior 2, or rather Earthsiege, IA is also mission-based and before every
  mission you can choose a robot and it's equipment as you want. Controls are
  very simplistic, you may not even know half of them and still win. Graphics
  are not true 3D, but a combination of 3D world and sprite characters. Levels
  are partially destructible - you can damage surroundings, street lamps for
  example. And a  really notable thing about Iron Assault is cut scenes. They're
  made using very unusual technique for computer games - stop motion
  animation(just remember classic King-Kong movie).
