  Terra Probe is a single player, shareware, Boulder Dash type of game. The
  player controls a probe which tunnels through the earth creating a tunnel
  wherever it goes. The object of the game is to collect all the diamonds to
  complete the level while avoiding falling rocks, mining droids that hunt the
  player down, and of course not getting trapped.

  In addition to the basic hazards the player will also encounter pressure crushers that will turn boulders into gems, explosives, lasers, and cave creatures. Once a level has been cleared a vortex appears which transports the player to the next level. The game is entirely keyboard controlled.
