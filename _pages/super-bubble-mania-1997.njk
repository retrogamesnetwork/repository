description: Super Bubble Mania is a shareware Pang clone. As in the original
  game, up to two players have to clear the screen of bubbles and other bouncing
  objects within a time limit. The characters move sideways on the bottom of the
  gamefield, climbing ladders, platforms and shooting harpoons that divide the
  moving targets into smaller, faster versions of themselves. Like in an arcade
  machine, the second player can join at any time. The game has three modes.
  World mode is the main game, where players go from level to level (50 total)
  of increasing difficulty, with five boss battles. Crazy mode has 50 expert
  levels for master players. Mania mode is the survival mode, where the levels
  are devoid of platforms and other obstacles and only have the bouncing target
  objects. Power-ups and bonus points drop from destroyed objects and can be
  collected from the field. Harpoon tips change the characteristics of the
  weapon, making it stick to the top or allowing several simultaneous shots. An
  alarm clock stops the movement of the objects, and a hourglass adds a few
  seconds to the timer. The gameplay is very similar to Dinosaur Balls.
