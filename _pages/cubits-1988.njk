description: A fast-paced game played on a series of abstract, isometric grids
  within a cube.  Each cube has three levels - the objective is to transfer all
  the cubits (red tiles) to the next level, through the elevators in the
  corners.  They are manipulated by flipping, kicking ( Pengo -style), or
  pushing them around ( Sokoban -style).  Once they're all cleared away, you
  take the elevator yourself and emerge at the next level. This has to be done
  before time runs out, and to make your life harder, the wandering
  "time-wasters" will take precious seconds off the clock if you bump into them;
  you can temporarily get rid of them by squashing them with tiles.  Special
  bonus squares appear and disappear at random, and if you collect six of them
  you'll gain some extra time.
