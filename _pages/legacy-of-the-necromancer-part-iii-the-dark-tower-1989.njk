description: "After the happenings of part II, the player reaches the
  Necromancer's former domain: the Black Lands of Bakarok. The task at hand is
  finding a way to the tower and using one of the items found in the
  Necromancer's palace to stop whatever evil is happening there. In order to win
  the game, the player needs to solve puzzles by collecting items (the inventory
  can hold six) and entering commands into the parser. It supports most commands
  and abbreviations found in Zork. Like in those classic adventure games, the
  player can die and render the game unwinnable with certain moves. Resource
  management includes thirst, hunger, air (when underwater) and lamp power. This
  game is second part of the Legacy of the Necromancer series. Although all
  three parts were released simultaneously and share the same gameplay
  mechanics, they could be purchased and played individually."
