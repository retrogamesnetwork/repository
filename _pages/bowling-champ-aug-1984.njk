description: Bowling Champ!! is a simple bowling game for one to four players
  with text graphics. After entering the number of players, their name(s), and
  setting a difficulty level the game begins. It plays left to right across the
  screen. At the far left the ball oscillates rapidly at the end of the lane, by
  pressing the space bar the player releases the ball which travels across the
  screen and hits the pins at the far right. Scoring is as in a normal game of
  bowls. This game is adware. On exit the player is shown a message advertising
  "The Techstaff Amazing Preview Disk" a menu driven catalogue of IBM Shareware
  and Public Domain programs.
