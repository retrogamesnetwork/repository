description: "Backgammon is a computer version of the classic board game of the
  same name. It can only be played against the AI and is completely controlled
  with the keyboard: after the random dice roll, the player needs to specify a
  piece and where it should be moved to by entering the row numbers. There are
  also associated keys for moving a piece from the bar or moving it home."
