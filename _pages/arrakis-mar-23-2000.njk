description: Arrakis is a real-time strategy game created by Dutch programmer
  Stefan Hendriks. The game is set in Frank Herbert's Dune universe and borrows
  many elements from Westwood Studios' Dune II and Command & Conquer. Taking
  command of the forces of one of the three Great Houses, the player must
  conquer the planet Arrakis, which is the only source of the precious spice
  melange in the known universe. Arrakis features three single-player campaigns
  spanning over a total of 30 missions (ten per House), and also allows to play
  skirmish scenarios against AI opponents. While no multiplayer mode is
  available, there is a built-in random map generator for the skirmish mode, and
  an editor for the creation of custom user maps is included in the game
  package. The gameplay in Arrakis is modelled after the Command & Conquer
  series of games, with point-and-click unit commands, rubber-band group unit
  selection and the vertical sidebar interface for building and unit
  construction. The number of available units and structures is limited, and all
  Houses share the same technology tree, but this is compensated for by specific
  modifiers to unit cost, armour, speed and firepower. Thus, while the Atreides
  are the "average" House, the Harkonnens have more powerful yet more expensive
  and slow units, and the Ordos rely on fast, cheap but weak forces. The game
  uses custom graphics that more or less resembles Command & Conquer and Dune
  2000, whereas sound effects are all borrowed from Dune II. There is no music
  but the game engine supports playback of custom WAV files.
