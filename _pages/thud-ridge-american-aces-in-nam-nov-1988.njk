description: The game plot is set in times of Vietnam War, where you are
  American pilot of the Republic F-105 Thunderchief affectionately known as the
  "Thud", a conventional strike and "defense suppression" aircraft. North
  Vietnam was divided up by the US military into a set of target zones referred
  to for some reason as "Route Packages (RPs)". The most heavily defended area
  was "RP-6A", in and around Hanoi. To enter into this target area, the F-105s
  had to fly over a region of hilly ground that became known as "Thud Ridge".
  You are starting your career in "Wild Weasels" as Lieutenant, description of
  your first mission is to get the feel of your "Thud", but it is just a start
  of perilous and glorious ladder. The next missions vary from eliminating the
  Doumer tankers or bombing the bridge to dropping the leaflets or engaging the
  MiGs. Your rank may be raised if mission will be accomplished. In the very
  beginning of each mission you should read the mission description, accept of
  decline this mission, and equip your aircraft with weapons and supplies.
  Taking off the airbase either from Korat or another place, you should flight
  to your destination eliminating the opponent MiGs, run the "Ridge", and
  complete your mission. The gameplay flows in third-person view with common
  flight simulator abilities.
