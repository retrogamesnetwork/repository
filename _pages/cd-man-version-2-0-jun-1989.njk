description: Pac-Man, an arcade classic finds a new form in this very cute
  clone. CD-Man features 5 different worlds to pass each having nicely-drawn
  graphics in high-res EGA mode and therefore a new character, "The Snoofer"
  which was not available in version 1.5 (instead of it you were playing with
  your old pal). Created by two Swedish authors, Atilla Biro and Anders Moree.
