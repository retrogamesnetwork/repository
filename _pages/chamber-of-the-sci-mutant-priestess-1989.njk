description: "Set in a post-apocalyptic world, Chamber of The Sci-Mutant
  Priestess casts you as Raven, a young \"Tuner\" (psionic mutant), working for
  the Tuner Netwerk. One day, while out on assignment with his friend Sci Fi, he
  witnesses the massacre of a \"Normal\" village, by a group of Protozorqs
  (physical mutants). Raven and Sci Fi disobey their instructions from the
  Netwerk, and fight back against the Protozorqs. In the ensuing struggle, Sci
  Fi is captured and taken back to the Protozorqs' mountain temple. Raven vows
  to save her, and so gets himself captured, too. As the game starts, Raven is a
  prisoner in the crazy Protozorq temple, where something sinister and utterly
  insane seems about to happen. Apparently, Raven has to go through five
  ordeals, to become a \"Divo\" (a Messenger Of The New Solution). For each
  ordeal he completes, he receives a Vort skull. Can you complete the five
  ordeals, save Sci Fi and destroy the fiendish Protozorq plot, in time? Chamber
  of the Sci-Mutant Priestess (originally entitled Kult: The Temple of Flying
  Saucers) is a puzzle-solving adventure game. To solve the puzzles, Raven will
  sometimes need to collect and trade items; but more often, usage of the eight
  \"psi-powers\" is required. These powers range from a simple light spell
  (\"Solar Eyes\") to instant-kill (\"EV\" - extreme violence) and complex
  psychological effects (\"Brainwarp\"). The five ordeals can be completed in
  any order, or even skipped altogether to reach a different ending. A time
  limit is imposed on the ordeals, and is calculated by turns. A \"wait\"
  command, which skips a turn, is also available."
