description: "Inspired by the famous 1986 film, Top Gun: Danger Zone is a desert
  dogfighting air combat simulation set on board an aircraft carrier (the USS
  Brigham) patrolling the waters off Libya and the Middle East. You have a
  choice of two aircraft - the F-14 Tomcat (in which you also get a Radar
  Intercept officer to assist you) and an F-18 Hornet (where you'll fly solo).
  The choice of missions is limited to eight - intercept, escort, clear
  airspace, provide air support and run interference. However, you also get to
  participate in the \"Top Gun Challenge Board\" in the Officer's Mess, where
  you challenge 12 other fellow pilots in simulated one-to-one dogfights to
  practice your skills, get their respect and increase your ranking. You also
  have a choice of playing against the CPU or against another human player in
  split-screen mode. The flight model is not completely realistic - but it is
  not ridiculous, as in many other games (even today). The game aims to have an
  arcade-style simplicity for the flying, and adds character development similar
  to many RPGs."
