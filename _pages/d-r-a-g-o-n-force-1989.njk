description: "The D.R.A.G.O.N. Force is a mercenary team which only takes the
  most dangerous jobs. During the course of this game, they will take on twelve
  missions against drug barons and terrorists. The goals vary from target
  elimination to rescuing hostages. D.R.A.G.O.N. Force is a turn-based tactics
  game. During each round, the player assigns orders to the men, e.g. moving,
  firing or special actions, which are then simultaneously (together with the
  AI's choices) performed. There is a strategical map (shows the whole mission
  area) and the closer zoomed in tactical map. As expected, the three fire
  commands are especially important: the usual direct fire at an enemy,
  targeting a specific spot or an opportunity fire which gets triggered by
  passing by enemies. The environment, e.g. hedges buildings, may be used as
  cover and affects the line of sight. Before each mission, the player has to
  choose seven soldiers from a pool of 14. Each soldier has different training
  and therefore a different rating in the abilities medicine, machine guns,
  anti-tank weapons, scouting, sharpshooting, demolition and close combat. The
  next step is giving them equipment from a relatively expansive arsenal. The
  key to success is to have a mix of soldiers with the right equipment
  (obviously a soldier with low sharpshooting skill should not use a sniper
  rifle) which are prepared for all possible situations."
