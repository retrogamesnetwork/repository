description: Super Worms is a 3D game in the vein of Super Mario Kart. The game
  has two game modes. In the racing mode, up to two players (and a number of AI
  racers) can race their worms on a race track filled with power-ups. In the
  battle mode two players can try to beat each others worm in a death match
  arena with various power-ups. In both games the worms consist of a number
  circular segments which can be removed by hitting them with the right
  powerups.
