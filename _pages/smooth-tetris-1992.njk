description: Smooth Tetris is a clone with somewhat slower falling blocks than
  the original Tetris. The blocks fall into the bottom of a box, and are removed
  when a layer is filled. Each type of block removed adds to a rising bar-chart
  on the right of the main area. The blocks can be rotated, moved left & right,
  and dropped in place using the keyboard. The keys used can be reconfigured if
  needed. There is also a high-score list for your name when you end a game.
