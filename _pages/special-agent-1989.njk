description: Special Agent is a single player, interactive fiction adventure
  game. This game is one of a series of recreational adventure games from Conrad
  Button and is classed at a difficulty level of 'Expert'. The player takes the
  role of a secret and very special American agent. The president calls
  personally to ask that you go to Russia to get pictures of a new rocket they
  are testing so off you go.  As with most games of this genre commands are
  usually two word affairs, 'Go Taxi' 'get Camera' and so on. Some common
  commands such as directions, up and down can be shortened to single keys n, s,
  w, e, u, & d. The game has no graphics at all but it does have a save game
  feature
