description: "Bruno Vasto, a madman, has stolen the experimental SF-2 stealth
  fighter and threatens to blow up Washington D.C.!  It's up to you to
  infiltrate Vasto's organization and retrieve the fighter to save the
  world.  It's all in a day's work for David Wolf, the secret agent. David Wolf:
  Secret Agent merges digitized cinematic cutscenes with bitmap and 3D animation
  to create an action-based interactive movie. Four 3D action simulations are
  the heart of the game: HangGliding (with a machine gun mounted to the front),
  Sportscar driving (with a machine gun mounted to the front), Fighter
  Simulation (with a machine gun and a missile launcher mounted to the front),
  and Skydiving (no machine gun).  The player follows along with the story for a
  few minutes, then is attacked and must outwit his opponents to live."
