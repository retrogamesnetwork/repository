description: Time to take to the field and manage a cricket team. This
  one-player game allows you to choose your team from seven countries and play
  versus the other ones. You can choose from three lengths of tour (home and
  abroad). These tours include one-day, three-day and a full blown test match.
  The game is a standard managerial game with icons on the menu screen to allow
  you to manage your team. When you play a match a scoreboard appears with the
  runs totting up. Occasionally the game will show a highlight of a decisive
  moment. This is a side view, first showing the bowler then the batsman. Here
  the ball can hit the wicket. If the batsman hits the ball then it either shows
  a catch or a six. During the game if you are batting you can choose the next
  batsman when a wicket has fallen or if you are bowling then when things need
  changing you can change bowler.
