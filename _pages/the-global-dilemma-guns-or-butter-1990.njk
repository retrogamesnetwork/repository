description: "Following Balance of Power, designer Chris Crawford stuck to the
  big-picture approach but shifted the focus from power politics to
  macroeconomics. In a grassroots simulation of industrial production and
  allocation, players balance a country’s military and social spending to
  survive in an environment of fictitious nations competing for land and
  resources. Key element in the turn-based The Global Dilemma is a basic tree of
  industries such as coal mines, lumber mills or gunpowder factories. The entire
  production chain culminates in only two results: an increase in either
  military strength or population. Guns or butter. The careful balancing and
  channelling of the industrial production, stripped down to the most basic
  mechanics, is The Global Dilemma ’s fundamental challenge. A growing worker
  population is vital for the economy. A strong military is vital for conquering
  neighboring provinces, their resources and population. At the same time,
  rivalling countries threaten the borders, and troops must be deployed to the
  vulnerable spots on the map. Superiority in numbers wins the abstract clashes
  of armies. The expert difficulty level adds a diplomacy system in which
  nations form short-term economic alliances. The Global Dilemma sees Crawford
  refine his particular brand of socio-global simulations, reducing complex
  issues to basic cause-and-effects chains that have a distinctly educative
  edge. As usual, a well-written manual details the game’s mechanics. Crawford
  continued with Balance of the Planet (1990)."
