description: "Arcade Volleyball is a simple, two-player (human or computer)
  volleyball-like game where you have to, simply enough, bang the ball so that
  it hits the opposite player's ground. Some basic rules apply: when the ball's
  current owner loses a round (either because the ball touched the ground or he
  touched it for three times) the opposite player becomes the owner. If a player
  is not the owner of the ball and loses a round, the opposite player gains a
  point. The game is over when either player reaches 15 points."
