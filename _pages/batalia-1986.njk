description: "This two-player, ASCII-based arena combat game has a backstory:
  you and your co-pilot have been busted by Galactic police for smuggling
  illegal goods.  As it turns out, Galactic justice doesn't screw around, and in
  a touch of Imperial Roman flair, you've both been tossed into a labyrinth to
  duke it out with each other gladiator-style.  Only one will emerge alive. Each
  player is given a ship, which can shoot in four directions at once.  The
  arena's layout changes on every round, but the premise remains the same -
  maneuver your combat ship around the playing field, use the walls for cover,
  and kill your opponent.  The first player to win ten rounds will emerge
  victorious."
