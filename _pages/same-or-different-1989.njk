description: This is a very simple EGA game that displays a screen with four
  images  of random items and the child chooses whether all the images are the
  same or if one of them is different.  After answering YES or NO, feedback is
  given on correctness (if one image is different and the child answers
  incorrectly the image flashes on the screen to show them where the differing
  image is located) and the child then goes on to the next screen of
  images.  Ten sets of images are played through and the game ends with the
  child's score displayed.
