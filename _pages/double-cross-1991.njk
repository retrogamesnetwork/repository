description: Double Cross is a puzzle-solving game for two players. The aim is
  to build a solid bridge from one side of the board to the other while
  preventing the opponent from doing same connection. The board is composed of
  an array of dots - each one representing a valid place for playing piece.
  There are two sets of finish lines on the board (horizontal, vertical), each
  painted in the color that represents the player that must connect them. Each
  player takes a turn and places a piece with their color on one of the dots on
  the board. You may place your piece on any dot, except those that are on the
  outside of on one of your opponent's finish lines. The game continues until
  the construction of the bridge is completed or there is insufficient space on
  the board.
