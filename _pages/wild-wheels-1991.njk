description: "Wild Wheels is an action game in which two teams of five cars each
  try to bring a ball into other team's goal for points (more points are awarded
  for risky moves) and destroying all enemy cars. The player takes control over
  a single car which can be shown in various camera positions, most prominently
  directly behind the vehicle or top-down. There are also special fields on the
  field which grant advantages when passed. The single-player portion basically
  consists of a series of elimination matches with the goal to win all leagues
  of increasing difficulty levels. Between matches, the points earned with goals
  can be reinvested into new cars with better statistics - additionally they are
  also divided into five categories with different roles during the matches. The
  game features two control modes: in professional mode the player rotates the
  car when pushing left or right while arcade mode allows direct turns."
