description: "Fuzzy Worm is a Centipede -style shooter, very similar to the
  arcade original. Once again, a pastoral mushroom patch plays unlikely host to
  the casual mass destruction of small animals. Your gun is free to move through
  the bottom section of the playfield, and your mission is to defend your little
  slice of nature from vermin violation. The multi-segmented worm weaves a
  winding path in your general direction; if it reaches the bottom alive, new
  segments may appear. Once you finish it off, a bleeping 1-bit rendition of La
  Cucaracha will escort you to the next wave. Your other enemies are the spider,
  the mushroom-dropping flea, and the poisonous scorpion: you earn points by
  consigning them to gooey death, but each shot costs a point, so you'll have to
  make them count. The game comes in six difficulty levels and in two different
  versions - one in graphics mode, the other in text mode, so users of the
  original IBM MDA aren't left out in the cold."
