description: Another computerized version of the popular board game (also known
  as Othello), playable against the CPU or against another human player. The
  game board has eight squares on a side, initially with two chips for each
  player at the center.  The players take turns placing chips, aiming to trap a
  sequence of the opponent's pieces between two chips of their own.  The
  opponent's pieces are then reversed to the capturing player's colors.  When no
  more legal moves remain, the side with the highest number of chips on the
  board wins.
