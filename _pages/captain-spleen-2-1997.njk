description: "Captain Spleen 2 is a comedy sci-fi graphic adventure. Unlike its
  predecessor, the sequel exclusively uses point-and-click mouse controls
  instead of the keyboard, and its digitized sound effects require a Sound
  Blaster-compatible sound card. The central plot is that Colin Gagnon and
  Robert Randall, real-world creators of the game, have been kidnapped by a
  shadowy organization known as M.S.D.O.S. and it is up to Captain Spleen to
  save them. The starting location is a spaceship dealership, where you will
  need to buy a new ship. Once you have one, the main options are: navigate to a
  new destination, activate autopilot (to actually get to the chosen
  destination), check what cargo the ship is carrying, and save/load the game.
  You will need to find someone to join the crew of your new ship, and then your
  mission can properly begin."
