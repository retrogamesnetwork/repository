description: Xonix is a version of the arcade game QIX. The objective of the
  game is to draw rectangles in the space that occupies the main section of the
  screen while you avoid the enemies, both in the margins and on the drawable
  section, which can kill you on contact. Filling a percentage of the drawable
  area grants the player access to the following level.
