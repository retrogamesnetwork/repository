description: A hero saved the human race from utter annihilation by the gods.
  This same hero then was charged by the heavens to take care of young seed
  dropped from there. This seed becomes his daughter, and her guardian will be
  watching her progress. In Princess Maker 2 the player assumes the role of a
  father to the blessed daughter of the heavens. For the next eight years, the
  hero will nurture and guide her in the path of the player's own choosing. It
  is possible to choose the path of the zodiac-influenced daughter by scheduling
  her to jobs and schools, which will raise her statistics (strength, combat
  skills, cooking, faith, etc.) Each month allows the player to designate three
  different tasks for her to follow. Balancing between character development,
  stress level, health and financial income is the focus of this game. Mini
  sub-quests and various plot options revolve around  the young lady adventuring
  in the wilderness, provided that she's strong enough to tame the wilds. The
  player can equip her with armor and weapons to fight off wandering random
  monsters in turn-based combat. The game starts with the daughter at age ten,
  from which point the player guides her until her adult years. Choices made
  during the course of the game will determine her eventual marital status,
  accomplishments and her relationships with other people. There are 74 unique
  endings in the game.
