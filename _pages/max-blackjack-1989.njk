description: "This blackjack game may either be played against the computer,
  against another human rival, or (in a three-player game) against both of them
  simultaneously.  In contrast to most implementations (which reproduce the
  concept of playing in a casino), here the computer doesn't take on the
  dealer's role -- rather, it takes its own chances at the table and places bets
  out of its own wad of cash.  Each contender starts out with $100.  The player
  with the best hand wins the round, and the bout continues until only one is
  left standing.  While a hand is played, it's possible to hit, stand or even
  raise the stakes(!); another quirk is the somewhat peculiar deck of cards:
  aces are always high (11 points), but there are two unorthodox additions in
  the form of '1' and '0' cards."
