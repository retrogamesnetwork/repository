description: The Playroom is an educational game which is set in the locale of a
  child's bedroom. Almost everything on the screen can be clicked on, and the
  child will be rewarded by games, activities, or at least an amusing animation.
  In this first of what eventually became a trilogy of games including The
  Treehouse and The Backyard, children are encouraged to use the mouse by the
  wide range of interactivity with items on the screen. Games and activities
  encourage creativity, the learning of numbers, and letters, and the
  development of critical thinking.
