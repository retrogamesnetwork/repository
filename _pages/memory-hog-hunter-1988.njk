description: "A variation on Pac-Man born of the fact that, after all, 640 KB of
  RAM is not necessarily enough for everyone.  When IBM PC business applications
  started running into the conventional memory wall, various solutions began to
  crop up on the market, usually involving memory expansion cards. One of these
  was Intel's Above Board, as advertised by this game. Each level is a maze
  dotted with memory chips, and the player controls an actual Above Board: a
  cutesy anthropomorphized green PCB complete with RAM chips, a Stetson, cowboy
  boots, and a net for trapping Memory Hogs - pinkish little piglets that
  attempt to devour the precious silicon before the player can do so.  The
  \"super chips\", located in the four corners of each maze, will
  \"supercharge\" the player for a limited time, allowing the porcine pests to
  be captured.  Each hog snared awards a \"bonus software package\", bringing in
  several popular business applications of the day for a cameo role."
