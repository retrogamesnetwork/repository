description: "After having defeated the evil Grand Vizier Jaffar, the brave
  Prince claimed just one reward: the hand of the beautiful daughter of the
  Persian Sultan. However, as the Prince approached the palace, his appearance
  suddenly turned into that of a beggar. Someone who looked just like the Prince
  ordered to throw him out. It turns out that Jaffar is alive and back for
  vengeance. Banished from the palace, the unfortunately Prince must travel to
  faraway lands and find a way to defeat the villain. Prince of Persia 2 is,
  like its predecessor, a cinematic platformer. Much of the gameplay is
  reminiscent of the first game, focusing on precise jumping puzzles,
  swordfighting, and overcoming many hazards in order to stay alive.
  Swordfighting is more prominent and features situations where several enemies
  attack the Prince at once. Reinforcements may arrive after the Prince has
  eliminated all visible enemies. Like its predecessor, the game must be
  completed within a time limit."
