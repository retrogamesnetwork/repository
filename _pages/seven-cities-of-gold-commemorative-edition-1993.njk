description: Seven Cities of Gold (7COG), Commemorative Edition, is a PC remake
  of the classic game designed by Dan and Bill Bunten for the Atari and
  Commodore 64 computers.  You play an explorer commissioned by the King and
  Queen of Spain to voyage to a new world, claim land for the Crown, negotiate
  with (or conquer) the natives, and gain fame and fortune for
  yourself.  Between voyages, you'll have to buy and outfit ships and hire men
  to crew them.  As in the original 7COG, you can play at three different skill
  levels, and choose to explore either the historical map (consisting of the
  Americas at the time of Columbus' journeys) or a land form randomly generated
  by the game. As befitting a "Commemorative Edition," the PC version of 7COG
  has been beefed up with hi-res graphics and digitized sound. 7COG is a rare
  example of a game being completely redeveloped for a specific platform instead
  of merely being ported over. (However, Seven Cities of Gold did in fact come
  out natively for the PC in the mid 1980s.  --Ed.)
