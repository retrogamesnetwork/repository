description: Billiards Simulator is a carom billiards game which is played with
  three balls and on a table without pockets. In the first phase of the shot,
  the cue is aligned to the ball. Here the player can either use the full 3D
  perspective or a top-down view. After that, the used cue (there are three),
  the spin and the strength of the shot is chosen by aligning diagrams and
  sliders. Then the shot is performed and points assigned. Additionally the
  player can set certain parameters to change the game experience, e.g. ball
  weight, friction or rebound.
