description: Bonus is an Israeli computerized version of the word game Scrabble,
  completely in Hebrew. The game can be played between two players or against
  the computer. The name of the game is derived from the bonus squares placed
  outside of the regular game table. Successfully placing a letter on one of
  these squares may earn the player a bonus, automatically or through the
  completion of a mini-game.
