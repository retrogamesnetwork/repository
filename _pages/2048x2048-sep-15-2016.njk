description: 2048x2048 is an implementation of that omnipresent puzzle game
  2048, squashed down to 2048 bits -- that is, 256 bytes of executable
  code.  Being an exercise in sizecoding it is written in assembly language, and
  the source is included with the game. As with Gabriele Cirulli 's original,
  this is a sliding-block puzzle played on a 4x4 grid, with tiles numbered in
  powers of 2.  The cursor keys will shift all tiles simultaneously in one of
  the four directions, which also causes a new tile to pop up in one of the
  unoccupied squares.  Tiles with different values will block each other's
  movement; if two identical tiles are bumped into each other, the pair will
  fuse into a new tile with double the value.  The goal is to keep joining these
  identical pairs into higher numbers, up to 2048 and beyond, before the grid
  fills up completely (which ends the game).
