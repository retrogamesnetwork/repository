description: Wizard's Crown is a fantasy role-playing game in which the player
  creates a party of up to eight adventurers and takes them on a quest to
  retrieve a magical crown from a wizard named Tarmon, who sealed himself and
  the crown in his laboratory five hundred years ago. The game features tactical
  battles, during which the player navigates the party members in turns over the
  battlefield.  Different weapons demonstrate unique characteristics; for
  example,  spears can attack two squares away, flails ignore the enemy's
  shields, and axes have a chance of breaking them completely. Shields are used
  to defend against frontal attacks and those coming from whatever side the
  shield is equipped on. The player can opt to skip these details and have the
  battle proceed automatically. Experience gained by characters is spent on
  skills, attributes and life points. Unlike in most comparable games, classes
  and their unique abilities are not assigned to the characters, but must
  instead be "bought" by using intelligence points. The classes are Thief,
  Ranger, Fighter, Priest and Sorcerer; any of those can be combined with
  another one for a single character. Weapons can be imbued with various
  enhancements. Magical weapons inflict elemental damage (called "injuries" in
  the game); "Plus" weapons cause extra bleeding, which may affect the
  character's health, making him faint; "Life Blast" weapons can kill a
  character in such a way that he cannot be resurrected afterwards.
