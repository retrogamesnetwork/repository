description: "Into the Sun: Projected Distruction ( sic) is a Korean-made
  horizontally-scrolling shooter similar to IAS. The player controls a fighter
  craft that flies above planet surfaces and traverses hostile bases in order to
  avert a threat imposed by an alien force on humanity. The preceding game's
  secondary weapon that specifically targeted enemy missiles has been replaced
  by a more conventional powerful all-screen attack. Missiles, smart bombs, and
  satellite guns are not available as power-ups any more, and must be purchased
  in a store between stages."
