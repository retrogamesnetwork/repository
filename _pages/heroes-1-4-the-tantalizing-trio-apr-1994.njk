description: "Heroes 1/4: The Tantalizing Trio is the shareware prequel to
  Heroes: The Sanguine Seven. The villainous Wild Hare and his band of minions
  are rampaging the city. Taking control of a superhero team, the player must
  defeat Wild Hare's henchmen and bring him to justice. In the shareware
  version, only three out of seven superheroes are available: the Flying
  Squirrel, Rockettress and Gumwad. There are ten levels in The Tantalizing
  Trio, with 50 more levels included in The Sanguine Seven. Gameplay is largely
  identical to the registered game. One notable difference is that the the
  Flying Squirrel's colour scheme has been changed between the shareware and the
  registered versions."
