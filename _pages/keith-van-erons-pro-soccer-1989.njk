description: "Arcade-style soccer game. It has two different parts: Indoor and
  Outdoor. The Outdoor game is the normal European soccer. You may play single
  matches, league or tournament (world championships). Optional features are:
  weather effects, replays, customizable game length. Some quite funny movements
  and shots are available (e.g. banana flanks). The Indoor game has US soccer
  teams (?fictional?) and plays on a much smaller field. It has different rules
  compared to outdoor soccer. You can play single matches, league and All Star
  tournament. The same movements and shots can be made, sometimes with even
  funnier effects (e.g. banana shot bouncing of the wall and into goal)."
