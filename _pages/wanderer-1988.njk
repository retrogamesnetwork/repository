description: Wanderer is a boulderdash-like game. Each tile contains a terrain
  and passing it gives a number of points. Levels contain earth, boulders,
  teleporters, balloons, monsters, and more hazards. The objective is to collect
  all treasures and kill all monsters. When you have done so, you may finish the
  level by moving to the exit.  Wanderer comes with 60 levels and a level
  editor.
