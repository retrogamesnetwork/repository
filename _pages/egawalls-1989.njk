description: Egawalls is a two-player breakout clone with 48 stages. The
  two-paddle simultaneous gameplay allows for one player to concentrate on the
  ball, while the other catches the bonus blocks. You can collect power-ups and
  letters to form the word BONUS for a bonus score. Power-ups include C for an
  extra blocking tile at the bottom, H to teleport the ball to the upper area of
  the screen, E for extra life, A to immediately advance to the next stage.
