description: "As the thinly-veiled title suggests, Packman is an overt Pac-Man
  clone, written in compiled BASIC.  The maze is rotated 90 degrees from the
  original layout, but the idea remains the same: clear each level by munching
  on dots, collect the occasional prize item for bonus points, and dodge the
  four ghosts that roam the corridors.  The power capsules in the corners will
  temporarily slow down your enemies, and allow you to catch them for increasing
  point awards; when the effect wears off, they will flash and revert to their
  normal, mean state. Each level kicks the difficulty up a notch.  You start
  with three 'packmen', and gain an extra one for every 10,000 points."
