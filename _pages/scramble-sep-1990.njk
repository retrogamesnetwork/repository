description: This game centers around rearranging the letters of words.  It has
  several different modes.  In the standard game, a word is presented and the
  player must find as many words as possible by mixing around letters from the
  word.  In the "anagrams only" game, things work much like the standard game,
  but the player must use all of the letters of the word to make new words;
  subsets are not allowed.  In "?-letter words only," the player may only create
  words of a specified length.  Finally, in "unscramble," the word's letters are
  initially displayed as a jumble and the player must rearrange them.  When the
  player quits, the game displays any answers that were missed and gives
  statistics regarding play.
