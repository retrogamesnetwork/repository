description: Britt Alcroft's train-based characters (famously voiced by Ringo
  Starr) were brought to several computer games, and this is perhaps the most
  unusual, simplifying the game of pinball to aim it at younger players. Four
  different tables are included, based loosely around Thomas, James, Percy and
  Toby. Up to 8 players can take it in turns, and there are 3 skill levels and a
  high score table. The tables vary in their complexity and difficulty; Thomas'
  is very basic in its design, while the others (especially Toby's) have more
  advanced ramps and combos. Full screen and scrolling view modes are available,
  and the game's feel is comparable to the Pinball Dreams series, which is
  unsurprising as Spidersoft did Pinball Mania themselves.
