description: "Baron Baldric: A Grave Overture is the shareware version of Baron
  Baldric: A Grave Adventure. It includes three levels that are not part of the
  10-level registered game. Gameplay mechanics and objectives are the same: the
  Baron must explore the crypts while collecting treasure, food and flint to
  maintain sources of light, and avoid various traps and perils, including the
  wolf-ghost of his ancestor Baron Lazarus."
