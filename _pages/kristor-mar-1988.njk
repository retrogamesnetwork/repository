description: "It is the seventh millennium; the Earth is devastated, after
  centuries of war and multiple nuclear winters that caused a succession of ice
  ages. Sounds bad? It gets worse: the extreme irradiation has mutated the
  species, splitting it into four sub-races barely recognizable as human.
  Escaping the inhospitable Earth, the factions have established themselves on
  other planets. A brave new chapter in history unfolds amongst the stars, as
  mankind begins to play out its potential upon the vast galactic stage:
  finally, there's enough room to really get serious with maiming, killing and
  destroying. Kristor puts the player in command of one of the four factions.
  Expansion and survival depend on a single vital factor: energy, which is
  produced by harvesting mineral resources. These come in three varieties
  (kristor, magnetronium and plasma) scattered throughout the various star
  systems in the quadrant. Stars may be explored (to prospect for minerals) by
  sending out unmanned probes; full-scale squadrons can then be launched to
  claim the system and install a mining unit. The other three powers don't sit
  idly by - resources are limited, and competition is fierce. Alliances are
  formed and dissolved, and battle may be joined when a squadron encounters
  enemy forces (resulting in a first-person, action-oriented fighting sequence).
  Construction of ships, probes and mining equipment can be planned and modified
  according to available energy. All game events are tracked in real time. The
  game comes with a cassette tape containing an audio recording, designed to be
  played in sync with the intro."
