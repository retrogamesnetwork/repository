description: BassTour is, as the name implies, a fishing game. It is by Richard
  Olsen who developed Bass Class and BassDuel, In all BassTour will support up
  to fifty different lakes which were available for purchase as separate
  products. Nels Anderson who is listed among the credits, also developed
  BassMap, a shareware utility that could be used to create new lake maps
  BassTour has three levels of difficulty Novice, Intermediate, and Pro together
  with a practice mode. In the game the object is to catch as many fish as
  possible in a three day tournament with the greatest weight winning the match.
  The player fishes for a six hour session each day, in game time not real time,
  and all catches must be weighed in before the end of the day, failure to weigh
  in means no credit for all that work. In addition the players must manage
  their fuel and battery power to ensure they are not left stranded on the lake
  and select the correct rod and bait for the environment. To aid the
  fisherman/woman they are given a boat which is equipped with a motor, fixed
  amount of fuel, chart recorder, rod & tackle boxes etc. The player can fish in
  six different lakes in the basic version of the game and the computer places
  the fish in realistic locations depending on the lake's topography. The game
  also features a quoted thirty "of the top names in bass tournament fishing" as
  opponents.
