description: "Expo may be thought of as an exploration-based puzzle game: each
  level strands the player somewhere within a scrolling overhead map, and the
  goal is to find a way out of the maze-like surroundings.  This is done by
  finding and collecting the required golden keys (a different number on each
  level) and then reaching the exit.  Trouble is, you have a limited number of
  moves (or 'rounds') to carry out your escape: take too many turns, and you're
  out.  You'll also have to watch your life meter, which denotes your bodily
  resistance towards various dangers lurking in the wild. The exotic terrain
  contains many such perils, like water and muck tiles that drain away energy
  when passed through.  Other, more specific locations can restore your strength
  somewhat; you may find that some award you points (or take them
  away).  Sometimes a teleporter will stand between you and the exit, but
  there's an entrance fee - which must also be covered by the points you
  earn.  In short, blazing a trail through the levels will require careful
  planning and strategizing."
