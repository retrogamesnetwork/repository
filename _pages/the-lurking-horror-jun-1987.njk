description: Despite a terrible snowstorm, a young G.U.E. Tech student travels
  to the school's computer lab to work on his grad paper. However, something
  strange has happened. The file containing the student's document has been
  partially overwritten by the Department of Alchemy's files. At first the
  student's only goal is to retrieve his lost document, but soon he realizes
  that something far more sinister is occurring in the depths of the school
  building. The Lurking Horror is Infocom's only horror-themed text adventure
  game. The game is set in the haunted school building, in the midst of a
  blizzard that rendered escape impossible. The player explores the environments
  and has to solve puzzles to overcome obstacles. There are hostile creatures in
  the game, most of which must be defeated or outsmarted by using specific
  items.
