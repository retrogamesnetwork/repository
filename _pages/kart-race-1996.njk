description: Kart Race is, as the name implies, a racing game featuring small
  four-wheeled open vehicles known as karts. The competitors are children aged
  eight to twelve. Players can select any of the eight available characters and
  either race against the computer AI or compete with each other in a two-player
  mode. The circuits include various natural environments such as fields, water,
  icy areas, desert, etc. Each character has a health bar that can be restored
  by driving over food scattered through the stages. In addition, characters can
  pick up bowling pins and clubs, which will allow them to throw at enemies
  bowling balls or fireballs of limited quantities, respectively. In all stages
  there are also yellow barrels that will incinerate a character upon contact,
  stopping him or her for a short while.
