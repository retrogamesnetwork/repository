description: "Ten years have passed since the events described in Pool of
  Radiance, and the heroes return to the city where it all started, Phlan. The
  city is thriving, and looks quite idyllic; but a sinister force is lurking
  deep in the shadows... After the heroes leave to escort the council member
  Sasha on a diplomatic assignment, the evil Lord Bane sends four of his most
  feared lieutenants to destroy the cities of Faerun and twist our dimension.
  The goal is clear: explore the land and rid it of the evil, by taking on
  Bane's minions one by one... Pools of Darkness is the fourth of Gold Box
  series of classic-style AD&D-based role-playing games. The gameplay is quite
  similar to other games of this type. At the start of the game, the player
  creates a party of characters (up to 6). Classic AD&D races (dwarf, elf,
  half-elf, gnome, etc.), character classes (fighter, paladin, monk, wizard,
  etc.), alignments (Good/Evil and Lawful/Chaotic axis), and statistics
  (strength, intelligence, wisdom, etc.) are there for the player to choose and
  adjust. Once the party is created, the player begins the exploration of the
  city of Phlan. Upon exiting the city, the player explores a top-down map,
  visiting dungeons and other locations of interest, as well as engaging in
  combat. The turn-based combat is done in similar style as other Gold Box
  games: the player navigates characters one by one on the top-down battle
  field, assigning various commands. Experience points are gained after
  successfully defeating enemies. Enemies appear randomly on the world map as
  well as in dungeons."
