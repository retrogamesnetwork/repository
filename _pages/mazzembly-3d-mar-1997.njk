description: "Mazzembly 1997 receives an extra dimension in this extended
  tribute remake, which still stars aspiring demoscener Demulamu as he tours the
  \"virtual reality demo party\", trying to accumulate eliteness and fame on his
  path to scene g0dhood.  His escapades now take the form of a 3D dungeon
  crawler, where the randomly-generated levels are experienced from a
  first-person view; climbing up the ranks will involve wandering around,
  interacting, finding/buying/using items, participating in party events, and/or
  resorting to violence (booze optional). The typical scenedudes still infest
  the party place - lamers, elites, and organizers, now joined by traders,
  reporters, and the dreaded Q-Bitches. There's a new Energy stat (rechargable
  by sleeping or eating), which will determine your combat prowess, and some
  more pathways to notoriety: for instance, collected hard drives can now be
  used to submit compo entries for money prizes and fame.  Money can also buy
  food, drink, maps, radar equipment and even heavy weaponry; boozing may result
  in harsh disciplinary action, but (of course) makes you more ELiTE.  Your goal
  is to build up as much fame as you can before the end of the party... or die
  trying!"
