description: Brandon's Big Lunchbox is an educational game for children age 3 to
  7. Included are 26 games to help with reading and math skills. The reading
  games include variations on reading and memory skills, matching words,
  recognizing letters, and finding letters on the keyboard. Some of the games
  are checked by the computer, however some of the reading games are designed to
  be played with a parent who can confirm pronunciation and understanding of
  words provided. The reading games also allow the words that are used to be
  customized. The math games feature several variations of problem solving and
  number recognition. These games provide simple math problems to solve, show
  objects on the screen that need to be counted, and some simple word problems.
  There are also a few games intended to be fun such as a matching game, a game
  where the player can specify dance moves for an alien, and an animated fishing
  display.
