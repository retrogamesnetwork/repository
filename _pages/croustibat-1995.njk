description: Croustibat is a game created to advertise the Croustibat line of
  fish sticks by Findus. It is a point-and-click puzzle adventure game that
  features the mascot, who is also named Croustibat. It was created by Coktel
  Vision using their Gobliins engine. It could be obtained by sending a letter
  to Findus for just the cost to cover shipping and handling. It also was
  included in a contest by Findus in which the winner would win a new personal
  computer system.
