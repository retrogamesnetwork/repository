description: This is a clone of the Tron light-cycle style game where the object
  is to make your opponent(s) crash into your tail as you move around the
  playing field. This version includes many options that you can set (including
  up to four players, any/all of which can be controlled by the computer), and
  you can save your options so you won't have to set them each time you play
