description: "Operation: Airlift is an action game which somewhat mimics the
  style of Choplifter. One or two players pilot a helicopter on a mission to
  rescue MIAs while avoiding enemy fire. The game uses EGA graphics and was
  released for free, serving as a demo for the ProGraphx Toolbox icon routines
  by Stanwood Associates."
