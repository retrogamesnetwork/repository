description: In the golf simulator you are allowed to win in Scottish Open on
  Championship Golf Courses, including The Bowery, Kilmarney, Penperro, and
  Carnoustie. There are many players in the game, who can rise during the
  playing. You can choose, edit or create one of them. Choosing a club, striking
  a ball, and counting turns, you have to beat your opponents, taking into
  account wind and height of landscape. The game employs 3 different camera
  angles to capture the most realistic aspect on the course.
