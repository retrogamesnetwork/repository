description: Sliders is a simple futuristic sports game that isn't a world away
  from Marble Madness. You control a ball over a futuristic landscape, the idea
  being to find the puck that's hidden somewhere in the level and "herd" it back
  to your starting point. Sounds simple enough, except for one thing; there's
  another player (either computer or human) trying to do the same thing. This
  results in incredibly hectic gameplay. Add this to the fact that sometimes
  you're negatively charged to the puck (and thus kick it away) or positively
  charged (so the puck sticks to you) and you're in for a crazy time!
