description: Rocket Lander is a conversion of the arcade game Lunar Lander. The
  object of the game is to land a space craft on the landing pad while avoiding
  the mountainous terrain. This is accomplished by adjusting the thrust and
  tilting the rocket left or right so your rate of descent is slow enough to
  land safely. The rocket crashes if the rate of descent is too fast, or the
  misses the landing pad. After reaching 100 points, advanced mode begins which
  features more difficult terrain.
