description: Tommy's Tenpins is a single-player, shareware game for up to four
  people. As with most of Tommy's games it uses character graphics and is
  entirely keyboard controlled. It has basic sound effects and command line
  switches which, among other things, can start the game with sound turned off
  and/or force either a colour or monochrome display. This game has nine skill
  levels, in-game instructions, a high score table and basic sound. The lower
  half of the screen is given over to a representation of a bowling lane running
  left to right. On the far left the ball, represented by a 'O' character, moves
  up and down at the end of the lane with great speed. The player has to judge
  the right time to press the spacebar to release their ball. The ball travels
  in a straight line across the screen where the pins are set up. Success here
  depends on timing, there's no allowance for spin, or the speed or weight of
  the ball.
