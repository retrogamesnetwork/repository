description: "Starball PC is an odd pinball game based largely on the game
  called Spaceball (named Starball in the original German release) on the Atari
  ST. While this game is a typical pinball, it also present many bizarre,
  innovative concepts. It consists of one huge table, which in turn consists of
  3 main parts, each with its own set of flippers. Should your ball fall between
  the flippers it will drop to a lower level until finally you're at the bottom,
  and then you lose a life. Each part of the table has its own quirks, secrets
  and purpose (for example, in the middle section you build a spaceship and have
  to protect it from two missile-firing guns on the right. There are also
  hidden, or secret, stages in the game: one is an \"egg\" with four parts you
  have to crack, another is a breakout clone only with pinball mechanics and
  another is a bizarre \"Doom pinball\". There's also the ultra-secret (and very
  hard to get to) Llama pinball game."
