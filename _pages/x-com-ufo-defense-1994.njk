description: "In the year 1998, the amount of reports of UFO sightings has been
  drastically increased. Stories about abductions and alien attacks became more
  and more widespread. Finally, after various nations of the world have failed
  to intercept the UFOs, their representatives met in a conference of global
  importance in Geneva, Switzerland. It was eventually decided to organize a
  secret paramilitary group, dubbed Extraterrestrial Combat Unit (X-COM).
  Starting with one base, two fighters, one transport, and a few soldiers, X-COM
  must locate the aliens, learn about their origins and technology, find out
  where their base is, and destroy it. X-COM: UFO Defense is a strategy game
  featuring separate but interlinked elements. On the strategic side, called
  GeoScape, you get a rotating view of the globe, where you see all visible UFOs
  (those that are within your detection range) as well as major cities and your
  base(s). You order movements from here, such as sending out fighters to
  intercept UFOs, transports with soldiers to assault/recover UFOs, and perhaps
  assaults on alien bases (if you find any). You also control your research, as
  you must invent better weapons (the Terran weapons are just no match against
  the alien weapons) quickly, not to mention all the other cool tech you can
  recover from the aliens. You also need to control your budget, as you can't
  afford to overextend your reach. Researchers need to be paid, engineers (who
  build the new toys) need to be paid, base(s) need to be be built/expanded,
  planes need to be bought/maintained, supplies need to be replenished, and so
  on. You can earn money by selling unneeded stuff, and you receive funding from
  the nations of the world; however, a nation can decrease its funding if it
  decides you aren't operating efficiently enough within its region. It's even
  possible that a nation gets so fed up with you that it signs a pact with the
  aliens and ceases funding altogether. Once you join a ground battle, the game
  switches to Battlescape, which is an isometric view of the battlefield with
  realistic line-of-sight calculations and turn-based combat. Your mission is
  usually extermination of all aliens on the battlefield, though if you can
  capture a few it would surely help your research efforts. If you win, you also
  recover any alien artifacts left on the field, which can then be researched.
  In combat, each of your soldiers has a specific number of Time Units. Doing
  anything (moving, shooting, turning around, rearranging objects in the
  inventory etc.) costs a number of TUs. Once a soldier is out of TUs, he cannot
  act any more this turn (he gets all his TUs back on the next turn, though)."
