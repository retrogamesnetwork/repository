description: "Project: Weltuntergang (\"Project: Doomsday\") is a standalone
  modification for the first-person shooter Wolfenstein 3D. The player controls
  B. J. Blazkowicz from the original game, who needs to infiltrate castle
  Blutigbeil where secret Nazi chemical weapons are being produced. The gameplay
  remains similar to the original game. There are some added features, such as
  armor that protects the player from attacks but wears down quickly, deadly
  landmines, and some new enemies, such as Panzerfaust-wielding guards and
  tanks. The player can use two chainguns at once; he can also find an entirely
  new type of rifle, which uses special ammo. It's also possible to find holes
  and ladders which transport the player to other rooms. On some levels the
  player rides a motorbike, which is hard to control, but can be used to kill
  enemies by running into them."
