  Tommy's Zombies is a single player, shareware, shooter with character
  graphics. The player starts the game in a three roomed house. Outside in the
  fields are zombies who congregate around the house in ever increasing numbers.
  Eventually they will break in through the doors and walls and though the
  player can move items of furniture around to delay them this too will be
  destroyed in time.

  Zombies can be shot but most of the time they will reanimate, unless the are eaten by their fellows. There is no score in this game, no save game feature and no high score table. The objective is simply to survive as long as possible. The game is entirely keyboard controlled, the space-bar is used to shoot the zombies however no bullets are drawn on screen. It has basic sound effects and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display
