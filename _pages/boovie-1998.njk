description: Boovie is a remake of the 1994 ZX Spectrum game with the same name.
  It was released in the same year as the Spectrum sequel Boovie 2. The game
  consists of a series of single-screen platform levels where a sequence of
  actions needs to be completed to progress. This involves shooting and avoiding
  enemies, destroying blocks and moving blocks around. To complete a level a
  specific brick needs to be transported to the tile marked with an arrow.
  Boovie is the main character and he can move around freely. Rather than pure
  platforming with jumping, he can move over any square on the game screen as
  long as it is not obstructed, as if he were floating in the air. The plot has
  Boovie rescue his wife Lili who has been kidnapped. The couple lived happily
  on the outskirts of a town until a wealthy person decides to build a large
  mansion next to their house. When bricks disappears from the construction
  site, the foreman kidnaps Lili and demands the bricks as ransom.
