description: "The first of several re-releases in the Front Page Sports:
  Football series from Dynamix/Sierra, the initial 'Pro' version boasts a number
  of improvements designed to widen the appeal of the series. The NFLPA
  (National Football League Players Association) granted the game a license,
  which allowed the use of almost every NFL player's real name in the team
  rosters.  Team customization got a boost with the ability to assign uniform
  colors.  An All-Pro game was added.  Ball carrier AI was upgraded, and the
  game shipped with about one thousand stock plays (many times the size of the
  original game's playbook.) On-field graphics were also touched upon:  this
  game uses the same graphics engine as its predecessor, but features more
  animations including spins and flips, and tweaked camera angles (including one
  new angle plus a blimp's-eye view) for better visibility and a more cinematic
  feel."
