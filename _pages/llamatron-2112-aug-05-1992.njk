description: A clone of the original Robotron, Llamatron uses the same principle
  but ups the action level, graphics and sound. For those who haven't played
  Robotron, the aim is simply to control you character (in this case a llama),
  shoot all the various monsters and rescue all the innocents (sheep). Your
  weapon is always on automatic fire and you shoot in the direction you are
  facing but if you hold the fire button it locks the gun in that direction
  allowing you to move around.  Various power-ups are presented to you during
  the game and two-player support is also in there.
