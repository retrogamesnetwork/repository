description: "Spheroids is a non-scrolling, top-down shooter with following
  background story: Robots attack Earth. The robot ships attack in waves and the
  direction they will enter the screen is shown with an arrow shortly
  beforehand. The player, of course, also has a space ship which is equipped
  with a turret which should be used to shoot the robots. The direction of the
  ship and the turret is changed independently, i.e. the player can move into
  one direction and shoot in another. Earned money is reinvested between levels
  for ship upgrades (speed, armor and turret) or powerful but limited special
  weapons."
