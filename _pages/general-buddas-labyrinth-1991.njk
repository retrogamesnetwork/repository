  General Budda's Labyrinth is a maze game where the object is just to find the
  way out of the maze in one piece. You drive a tank-like (though out of
  ammunition) vehicle through a static maze, and explore it, trying to find
  exits. In some rooms are robot orbs, that try to get close to you to explode
  and take some energy from your vehicle. A destroyed orb is permanently gone
  from the maze. Sometimes the orbs dig holes in the walls, and can come
  through. There are keys and walls with keyholes that opens if you found the
  key. The game was initially in three parts, the first being distributed as
  shareware, the other two were sent to you upon registering. The three parts
  are called: Episode 1 - The Orbs of Distruction

  Episode 2 - Evil Secrets!

  Episode 3 - Budda's Lair! In addition to the three parts, registering also got you an editor for making more levels for the game. The full game has later been released as freeware by the author, and is available for download.
