description: Soko-Ban is a classic puzzle game, the basis of numerous clones in
  the later years. It is set in a warehouse. On each level, the player must push
  crates (from square to square) to get them onto designated spots; once each
  crate is on a marked spot, the level is complete. Crates can only be pushed
  one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together),
  and cannot be pulled--so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where
  it cannot be retrieved! By the last levels, you must plan 40 steps in advance.
