description: Illusion Blaze is a Korean-made sci-fi horizontally-scrolling
  shoot-em-up. The player controls either of the two available spacecraft that
  must traverse hostile areas, dealing with regular enemies and bosses on the
  way. Power-ups include weapon upgrades, protective shields, and
  weapon-switching orbs. Like in Thunder Force IV, there are four types of
  weapons distinguished by their color; if the player has collected the
  corresponding orbs, it is possible to switch between them at will. Also like
  in Thunder Force IV, the player can select between four different initial
  stages.
