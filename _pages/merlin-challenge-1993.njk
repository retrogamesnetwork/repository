description: In this game you fly the Royal Navy Merlin helicopter, within the
  environment of the Navy's training simulation. The action is viewed in 3D from
  one of a range of camera angles, and digitised sound effects are included. You
  begin near a frigate, and the aim is simply to land on the stern of the ship.
  There are three difficulty levels, which increase the realism of the flight
  model, as well as adding other factors such as wind. Once you touch down, you
  are given a comprehensive scoring and review of your landing.
