description: "True to form, this Frogger derivative stars a green little
  amphibian whose only ambition is to make it safely to the other side of the
  screen.  You, the player, must guide it carefully across a multi-lane city
  street, hopefully without getting squished in the bustling traffic.  Then it's
  on to the river, where our toadie must employ logs and floating pads to keep
  from sinking.  Once four croakers are safely nestled in their alcoves along
  the top edge, a new and harder round begins. Toad Road is controlled and
  played somewhat differently from the classic formula: instead of jumping from
  one grid position to the next, the toad takes small steps, and cannot
  backtrack at all - it can only go forward or sideways.  Somehow, objects in
  the river don't impart any motion to their rider; as such it is necessary to
  keep walking sideways just to stay on top.  Other distinctive behaviors
  include the number of logs and their movement patterns, the snakes that patrol
  previously-safe areas as the game progresses, and floating pads that only
  become visible from the riverbank itself (which makes it harder to plan moves
  in advance)."
