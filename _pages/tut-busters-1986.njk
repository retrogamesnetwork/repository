description: A take on the Q*Bert formula with an ancient Egyptian theme.  The
  famous archaeologist Buster Cheops is treasure-hunting in the ancient pyramid
  of Amin Ramen, trying to recover some antique urns; he has to explore every
  block on the pyramid by jumping on it, which changes its
  color.  Unfortunately, the tomb's current residents aren't on board with
  Buster's scientific curiosity.  He finds himself chased around by the jumping
  skull of Amin Ramen himself, a cobra (named Sam), and a scorpion (whom we do
  not know on a first-name basis). To complete a level, Buster has to color all
  the pyramid blocks *and* collect the urn that appears at the top now and
  then.  Running into enemies (or falling off the pyramid) will kill him,
  although a new life is given at 50,000 points.  Some of the levels have a pair
  of magic carpets, which can carry him safely back to the top.  The three skill
  levels (beginner, expert, master) adjust the speed of the enemies for a more
  varied challenge.
