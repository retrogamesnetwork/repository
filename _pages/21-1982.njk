description: "A straight PC conversion of its card-based namesake, also known as
  Blackjack: each round begins with a bet, and the goal is achieving the highest
  hand without going over the value sum of 21. The computer (dealer) and the
  player both draw cards, and then decide their move - hit or stand, or (for the
  player) double, split or surrender; when the dealer has an upturned ace, the
  player gets the option for an insurance bet.  Gone broke? - the game ends, and
  shows you some statistics to review."
