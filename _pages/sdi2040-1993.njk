description: SDI2040 is a shareware, single player, Space Invader clone. As is
  standard in such games, alien ships march back and forwards across the screen
  coming ever closer to the player's ship. The objective is to destroy all of
  them before they reach the bottom of the screen. There is a high score table
  and when the game was registered both the source code and a SoundBlaster music
  pack were available, each for an additional fee.
