description: "Picking up immediately where Manhunter: New York left off,
  Manhunter 2: San Francisco has the player crash-landing their stolen ship in
  the City by the Bay after trying unsuccessfully to keep up with enigmatic
  serial killer Phil.  Left with no alternatives, the player assumes the
  identity of a local Manhunter and solves more crimes for the alien Orbs while
  searching for Phil and working for the local human resistance. Manhunter 2
  presents the same urban decay and oppressive alien invader regime as
  visualized in the original, this time using streets and landmarks from the Bay
  Area. The Golden Gate Bridge, Coit Tower, Alcatraz prison, and the
  TransAmerica Pyramid all receive alien makeovers. New puzzles, new characters,
  and new investigations await as the player tracks Phil by his string of
  strangled corpses. All concepts and gameplay elements from Manhunter: New York
  return.  The player again uses the MAD tracking device to follow suspects
  provided by the alien Orbs and uses clues found through first-person location
  investigation to discover the suspects' name.  Occasional arcade sequences
  bring mixed challenges, and though they cannot be skipped, a new difficulty
  option has been implemented. The same point-and-click gameplay (no typing
  required) is used to navigate the game world."
