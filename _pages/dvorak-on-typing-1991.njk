description: Dvorak on Typing is a typing tutor developed in conjunction with
  computer columnist John C. Dvorak. The program consists of lessons as well as
  a game. The lessons simply involve typing the keys shown on screen and there
  is a visual keyboard that highlights the location of the keys. On the screen
  are also two meters which give feedback on how well the player is doing, one
  for accuracy and one for WPM (words per minute). The lessons are voiced by
  either Dvorak himself, Tracy (a child's voice) or Loren (and adult women's
  voice). It is possible to use either a Qwerty or a Dvorak keyboard. Lessons
  can also be run in a timed mode. In the game the player controls a medieval
  knight that fights evil adversaries. As the player types the knight on the
  screen will attack the enemy. Faster typing leads to the knight being more
  successful in the fight. After completing a number of lines of text the player
  is allowed to rest for a minute and can then watch the knight in action.
