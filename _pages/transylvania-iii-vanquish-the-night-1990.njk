description: The evil Vampire, Lord Drakul had been destroyed and the throne
  regained in The Crimson Crown. Prince Erik and Princess Sabrina had fled by
  sailing boat only to be shipwrecked by a giant wave bringing them back ashore.
  After escaping death, Prince Erik wonders what has become of Princess
  Sabrina?  Alone on a mountaintop, he learns that he is in the land
  of  Slavaria, north of Transylvania... and that another Vampire controls the
  land. When tired, sleep in a safe place, or else wake from a horrible dream
  with two marks on your neck, after three visits you're done for. This time the
  challenges are far greater, and so are the number of locations. Bizarre
  characters and creatures lurk; from town-folk at the local inn who are not as
  they seem to horrible monsters and cute elks. They player may help others, and
  they might offer assistance. Explore the Egyptian museum for artifacts or get
  stuck in the maze to meeting the Queen. The ultimate goal is to destroy the
  vampire plaguing this land.
