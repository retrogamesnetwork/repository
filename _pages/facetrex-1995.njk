description: Facetrex is a single-player, block moving, keyboard controlled
  puzzle, shareware puzzle game. The shareware game contains twenty-five puzzles
  and five puzzle solutions, the full registered game contains fifty puzzles and
  has solutions to all of them. The puzzles are numbered and can be played in
  any order, they are all played on a grid on which are blocks each of which has
  a different picture of a face. Also on the grid there are a corresponding
  number of 'negatives', one for each face on the blocks. The player controls a
  little red man who occupied one cell on the grid, this man can push any of the
  face blocks up, down, or to either side. When pushed a block will continue
  moving until it hits another block or the side of the grid. Blocks cannot be
  pulled so once a block hits a wall it stays there. Some puzzles also contain
  black cells which cannot be moved and/or green cells which can only be moved
  one block at a time.
