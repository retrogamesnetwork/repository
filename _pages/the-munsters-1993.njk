description: The characters from the 60s TV series The Munsters have been
  transported away to a mysterious castle. Playing as different members of the
  family in succession, the player must rescue them. As you walk through each
  room, you must collect items to help you deal with each challenge. You must
  build up your spell power by shooting ghouls, zombies and vampires, as this
  allows you to deal with other challenges. Avoid contact with those monsters,
  as they will zap your energy and finally kill you - you have a single life.
