description: You have landed your crippled ship at the Atargis mining station.
  The platform was deserted and no one answered your radio calls. Now you are
  forced to enter the station and find a way to get off the asteroid. Hopefully
  whatever happened to the 200 personnel in the labyrinth of mines under the
  station won't happen to you too. Xenomorph is a first person RPG. Like in the
  Dungeon Master series, everything happens in real time. You move around in 10
  foot steps and can turn 90 degrees. You have two hands to fight and use items
  with, a belt and holster for quick access to weapons as well as an inventory
  for carrying things. The objective of the game is to find parts to repair your
  ship. You must also find food and water for sustenance and guns, grenades and
  mines for self defense. Other items can help you during your mission such as
  environmental suits, security passes and a motion detector. Data disks found
  throughout the station will fill in the story.
