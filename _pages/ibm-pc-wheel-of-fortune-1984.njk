description: 'Before founding PKWare and inventing the ZIP compression standard,
  Phil Katz produced at least one game as a hobbyist by-product of his
  programming career: a PC adaptation of the popular game show Wheel of Fortune
  -- albeit an unlicensed one written in BASIC.  Like its televised counterpart,
  this is a game based on solving word puzzles and getting rich in the process.
  One to five contestants may participate, and each in turn takes a stab at the
  blanked-out phrase.  Spinning the wheel determines a dollar amount and lets
  the player guess a consonant (which is then removed from the pool); in
  less-lucky occasions the wheel may land on "lose turn" or "bankrupt", forcing
  you to forfeit your shot or your cash respectively.  Alternatively, a vowel
  may be bought for a flat rate of $250, or you may attempt to guess the
  complete phrase and keep your accumulated cash (if successful).  After three
  rounds, the richest player gets the game.'
