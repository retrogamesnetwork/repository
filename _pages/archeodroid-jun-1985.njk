description: "To humans of the far future, the forgotten planet Earth is nothing
  but an old tale. That is, until a lucky explorer stumbles into the lost blue
  sphere... but will signs of ancient habitation be found? It's time to break
  out your three trusty Archeodroids - excavation robots programmed to retrieve
  archeological evidence. Their job? - to poke around in Earth's garbage, and
  retrieve the debris that holds the key to mankind's past: human skeletons, car
  debris and piles o' junk. Points are earned by bringing dug-up artifacts to
  the ship; each droid is equipped with ten power charges, allowing it to move
  and blast through the dirt. Trouble is, a chargeless droid will quickly
  self-destruct unless it recharges back at the ship - plus, cave-ins may block
  up the tunnels and even destroy the poor droid. A deceased droid's remains
  (and its collected artifacts) can be picked up by its successor. Your
  objective is to plan your excavations carefully, avoid getting trapped, and
  receive the maximum score for your findings."
