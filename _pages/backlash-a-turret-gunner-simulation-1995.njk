description: "Backlash: A Turret Gunner Simulation is a first-person space
  shooter where the player has control of a turret mounted on a spaceship, that
  must be defended from attack by other enemy ships, asteroids and other
  dangers. The turret has a limited number of rockets and a main weapon, which
  uses the same energy as shields; depending on the case the power level can be
  assigned to one or another system. Rockets (and other power-ups) can be
  purchased with credits earned by completing missions."
