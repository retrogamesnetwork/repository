description: The third part of the Game of Robot series takes place on the
  fictitious island of Fana, where the telegram the player received in the
  second episode came from. His task is to find the friend who sent that call
  for help. Compared to the earlier episodes, there is a bigger focus on the
  game's storyline. The inhabitants of Fana, the Tamala, speak their own
  language, which the player has to learn understanding and speaking bit by bit
  in order to solve the puzzles on the island.
