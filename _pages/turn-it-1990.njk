description: In this Mahjongg variant the player has to remove the tiles with
  the same marks from the board until all the board is completely empty. The
  elimination of tiles is allowed if these tiles are projected on the same line
  with no other tiles in their projection path. There are a certain number of
  same items on each level. The player can mark the tiles, or cancel the action
  to change the decision. The dead-ends exist if the strategy of tiles
  elimination was incorrect. Games are time-limited and a certain number of
  'next move' suggestions are available during gameplay. The game sports three
  difficulty levels as well as a 1 or 2-player mode. The best scores are saved
  in the high score table.
