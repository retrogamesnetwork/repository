description: "Your craft: an F-16, complete with 7 air-to-ground missiles and
  300 fuel units.  Your mission: go on a sortie over hostile territory and
  destroy enemy installations, by launching your missiles directly above
  target.  The action is controlled from a non-scrolling side view; each sector
  contains an assortment of targets, obstacles and traps.  You can clear a
  sector instantly by engaging your thruster, although this gulps down quite an
  amount of fuel. Ammo and fuel may be replenished at the floating resupply
  depots.  Run out of gas, or collide with anything at all, and your fighter
  will crash and burn - you only get two lives to rack up as many points as you
  can."
