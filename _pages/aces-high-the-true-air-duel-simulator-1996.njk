description: A two-player aerial duel.  The dogfight commences inside a
  wrap-around, top-down playfield, as each side tries to gun down the opponent's
  plane.  Game parameters are highly configurable, with adjustable values for
  physics and player variables; on-screen indicators help keep track of lives,
  power, ammo and damage during battle. Written in tribute to Iron Maiden and
  their song Aces High, the game also features a cover of the song (in .MOD
  format) as its background music.
