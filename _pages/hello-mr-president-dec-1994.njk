description: Hello Mr. President is a Korean-made humorous versus fighting game
  in which all the playable characters are contemporary presidents or prime
  ministers of different countries. These include Bill Clinton (USA), Boris
  Yeltsin (Russia), Deng Xiaoping (China), Margaret Thatcher (UK), Fran√ßois
  Mitterrand (France), Saddam Hussein (Iraq), Morihiro Hosokawa (Japan), and Kim
  Youngsam (South Korea). The player can choose the order of opponents for each
  character. The fighting takes place in the home country of the opponent, with
  matching backgrounds representing the location. The game also include a board
  game mode where the player moves the character on a board, solving various
  mini-games such as simple puzzles or answering trivia questions on the way.
  Succeeding in the board game allows the character to start the fight with
  better attributes. It is, however, possible to skip the board game entirely
  and go straight to the battles.
