description: You play Drak, the last of the Obliterators (genetically enhanced
  machines bio engineered for otherwise impossible missions.) Your mission is to
  save the Federation from an alien spacecraft. Obliterator is an arcade style
  platform action game. The game screens are static (instead of scrolling,
  though you can optionally turn on scrolling transitions between screens.) and
  can be maze like at times with many locations to search. Armed with a variety
  of weapons, you have to board the alien spacecraft, disable its weapons,
  plasma drives and shields, then escape.
