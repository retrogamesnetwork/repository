description: Navjet is a side-scrolling arcade game where you fly an attack
  aircraft to defend against enemy aircraft and naval force from a neighboring
  country. You start out in the center of the screen with eight lives, and your
  jet aircraft in the air over the sea, with the enemy coming from the right
  side of the screen. Movement up/down/left/right is allowed, so you can fly
  back to catch enemies who passed you, though you cannot move left of your
  spawn point. Waves of enemy aircraft start from carriers at your right, and
  move to the left and turn at your starting point, to come back from behind
  you. You can shoot a gun and drop bombs from your aircraft, and you never run
  out of ammunition. When you shoot some objects, you get stars hanging in the
  air, which are extra lives if you catch them by flying through them. If you
  shoot the stars, you lose them, and get no extra lives. If you reach the end
  of the map, you will find the enemies nuclear missiles, which you need to
  destroy to get to the next level. You also gain a password to each level, so
  you won't have to restart from the beginning if you restart the game.
