description: "It's one warrior against an empire, but you are a Fury, a paladin
  fighting for freedom, and you have nuclear missiles. Your mission is the
  liberation of Fornax, a peaceful planet firmly under the boot of the
  Interstellar Union of Civilized Peoples. The Union has tanks, skimmers, forts,
  and countless troops. You have a suit of force-shielded, powered armor which
  jumps, flies, self-repairs, and will even tend to your wounds. Skulk in the
  woods and snipe, or move fast and blast away. Either way, stay alive, complete
  your mission, and return to the recovery point. The game screen looks down on
  one of sixty-three square kilometers, resolved to twenty meters, showing
  terrain, your position, your enemies, and frequent blaster fire. Terrain is
  key to survival, as sooner or later you'll need to go to ground and heal up.
  However, it can hinder your reconnaissance as much as your enemies', and
  sometimes you'll find yourself under fire from an unseen source. Sound
  matters, too: your powergun is nearly silent, but the blaster alerts enemies
  as effectively as it destroys them. Play is turn-based, but fast. The
  opportunity to press the right key flits by quickly, bringing new bursts of
  enemy gunfire around you. Varying movement options, weapons, and enemies make
  tactics the determining factor in your success. Two scenarios fit into the
  story: a diversionary expedition to blast everything in sight (except the
  civvies, so check your targets!), and a search-and-destroy mission to start
  the revolution. Five difficulty levels and varying equipment (customizable in
  the disk version) lend additional variety."
