description: "Another text adventure game made with the Computer Novel
  Construction Set. The player takes a role of alien #28493 (later named Knoffel
  in Toxically Earth), whose starship has crashed in Reality-on-the-Norm. His
  task is to find a fuel to leave this town quite surrealistic for the aliens.
  The game is divided in two parts accessed with 'universe' and 'earthfly'
  passwords."
