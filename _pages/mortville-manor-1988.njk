description: "Mortville Manor is an adventure game which takes place in
  1951.  Someone is murdered in an impressive manor, and it's up to Jerome Lange
  to solve the case.  But beware: something otherworldly is going on here... The
  gameplay focuses on conducting a detective investigation rather than on
  inventory-based puzzles, though items must be found and examined for its
  purposes. Conversations with suspects offer a wide variety of topics. The
  player wanders through the mansion at his own pace, but events would sometimes
  occur regardless of his actions. The game's interface consists of a drop-down
  menu with about two dozen different verbs used for interaction."
