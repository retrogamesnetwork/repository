description: A game of maze navigation, in which you race against time through
  random-generated labyrinths of varying difficulty levels.  Not only does the
  complexity of the mazes vary, but another level of challenge is added through
  changes in the size of your viewport - more difficult levels zoom it inwards,
  making for a progressively shrinking section seen at a time. Quick navigation
  rewards you with accrued time bonuses for the next level; pebbles scattered
  through the labyrinth afford you points, as well as the option to drop them as
  landmarks - or to trade them in for a peek at the map.
