description: PC-Fender is a Public Domain version of the classic Defender. As
  with the original game and most of its clones it is a side-scrolling game in
  which the player flies a spaceship through a tunnel. The ship can fly left or
  right and the objective is to destroy all the alien ships and rescue the
  people that are being abducted. When a level is completed the player moves on
  to the next and continues until either all levels have been played or they
  exhaust all their available lives. Weapons include a forward firing gun, a
  smart bomb that clears all enemies from the screen, and a hyperspace jump that
  relocates the ship to another part of the game. The game is entirely keyboard
  controlled and the keys cannot be reassigned. There is no save feature.
