description: "On a space settlement named Contra, a human being serves as a
  regulator for the planet's vital systems: he controls transportation, weather,
  and manages resources all while being in a deep sleep, through the neural
  power of his brain. Such a regulator is called Central Mentality. However,
  after five hundred years of stasis, the current Central Mentality suddenly
  awakens, greatly troubled by reports of computer malfunctioning and resulting
  problems in weather condition, food production, and transport. He must now
  act, and act quickly: the crew members assumed that he has gone insane, and
  are coming to disconnect his mind. But what can he do if his state of
  suspended animation prevents him from moving? Suspended is a text adventure
  game with a twist: instead of navigating the protagonist, the player
  indirectly controls six robots that do his bidding, exploring the environment
  and interacting with it. Each robot has different functions and has its own
  way of seeing reality and reacting to events around it. Iris is the only robot
  that can see and therefore visually describe locations and objects; Whiz can
  provide technical information obtained from computers; the sonar-powered Waldo
  is good at holding items; Auda is an expert in sounds; the cryptically
  speaking Poet senses the flow of electric currents; finally, Sensa can detect
  magnetic and photon emissions. The player advances in the game by using the
  different abilities of the robots and solving puzzles."
