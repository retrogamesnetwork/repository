description: In Ambush at Sorinor six clans are at war with each other in the
  land of Sorinor. Each group is hiring mercenaries to kill opposing VIPs and
  protect their own. The player takes on the role of a mercenary commander, and
  tries to win battles either as offensive or defensive party. The game features
  a campaign, but its missions can also be selected individually. Before the
  fight, players hire mercenaries (which consist of fantasy characters like
  orcs, dwarves and goblins or humorous races like defense lawyers), which all
  have different statistics and special abilities. They cost money and the
  budget has to be met. Those are divided into groups, placed on the map and
  then the fight can begin. The battles take place in real time and players can
  issue various commands, e.g. waiting, ambushing or attacking enemy mercenaries
  - but only on the groups, not individual units. However, the group
  constellations can be changed during battle. The action can be paused at any
  time to analyze the situation and issue commands. Also featured are a map and
  a scenario editor.
