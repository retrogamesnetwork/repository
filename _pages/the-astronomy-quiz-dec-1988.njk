  This multiple-choice quiz game asks fifty questions about astronomy. It covers
  all facets of astronomy, its history, the cosmos and the people who discovered
  it.

  Interestingly, the player is given three marks and loses a mark every time a question is answered incorrectly. Bonus marks can be earned by answering five questions correctly. At the end of play, marks are cashed in for points, meaning that the best possible score is 63.
