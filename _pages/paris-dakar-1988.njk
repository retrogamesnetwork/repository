description: "Paris-Dakar is a rally simulator in which the player controls a
  wide variety of variables, including the state of the car (gasoline, water,
  damages, gear box...) and the race route (always accessible), among others. If
  needed, the player can refuel, buy water or whatever else is required from the
  powerboats in Europe or the tankers in Africa. Prices of these essential
  materials aren't always very reasonable, given the player's meagre starting
  wallet, motivating players to earn higher sponsorships through strong
  performance in the race. There are three different stages: one in Europe,
  another one in the desert of the Sahara, and finally a crossing of the Tenere
  desert before arriving in Dakar."
