description: "A demoscene-flavored adaptation of the Peg Solitaire puzzle: a
  board with a cross-shaped arrangement of holes, some of which are occupied by
  pegs.  The only legal move is to 'jump' a peg over a neighboring peg into a
  hole at the other side, which clears away the intervening peg.  The board is
  solved by removing all pegs except one; if all valid moves are exhausted
  before this happens, you lose - and have to start over. Poof offers ten levels
  of play, each with a different initial board layout."
