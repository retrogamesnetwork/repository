description: "As the youngest son of a Noble Merchant, an easy life lay before
  you. But the call of adventure beckoned, and so, you left your home for a life
  of action and danger. Sea serpents, storms and tattered sails have all proved
  perilous as the years passed. You've taken ships and defeated fiends, at the
  side of your instructor, the Master Corsair Sinbar. But your thoughts always
  return to Kara, the Caliph's beautiful daughter. It is for her you devote your
  skill and honors. And it will be her hand in marriage that will be your reward
  for attaining your goal of becoming a Corsair. Your adventure begins now, on
  the hidden isle where Sinbar tests his pupils. Al-Qadim: The Genie's Curse is
  an action role-playing game set in the Al-Qadim campaign of the Advanced
  Dungeons & Dragons pen-and-paper RPG. The gameplay alternates between visiting
  friendly areas, where the hero can talk to characters (including choices of
  dialogue lines and moral behavior), and exploring dungeons, where enemies must
  be fought in action-based combat. The hero can use melee weapons, a slingshot
  for ranged attacks, or cast magic spells. Experience points are awarded for
  defeating enemies; the player can raise the statistics of the protagonist
  should he gain a level. Acquiring special items and training may also
  permanently increase certain attack parameters."
