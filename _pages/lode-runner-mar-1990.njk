description: The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its
  rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture
  it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and
  ropes. The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and
  contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them
  is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to
  fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold
  has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is
  added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.
  This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the
  creation of new level designs with no programming skill.
