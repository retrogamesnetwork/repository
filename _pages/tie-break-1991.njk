description: This tennis simulation uses a top-down scrolling perspective. You
  are not in control of the player's motion, but once he gets close to the ball,
  shot selection is down to you. Standard shots plus topspin, lobs and stop
  volleys are available, by pushing the joystick in the right direction as you
  aim the shot. The game supports up to 16 players in singles matches on a
  variety of court surfaces.  It includes all of the major world tournaments -
  the four Grand Slam events at Melbourne, Roland Garros, Wimbledon and New
  York, plus the Davis Cup and Masters events.  An early attempt at TV-style
  coverage is offered.
