description: "In Gold Rush!, Jerrod Wilson (the player character) receives a
  letter from his long-lost brother (who fled the city years before when was
  hastily accused and convicted of a crime he didn't commit) asking him to join
  in Sacramento, California. If that's not enough for Jerrod sell everything and
  give his hometown Brooklyn a fond adieu, under the stamp was one of the first
  nuggets of Californian gold seen in the Atlantic shores of the United States.
  So, Jerrod bids farewell to his peaceful life as a newspaper editor, and
  becomes a fore-runner in the the great Gold Rush of 1849, hoping to find his
  brother and \"strike gold\" (literally). Released late into the lifespan of
  Sierra's AGI engine, Gold Rush! features some tricks not seen before the more
  advanced SCI engine, such as enlarged characters, but it is best known for the
  three routes available to reach California: by land, travel by boat to reach
  the Atlantic shore of Panama, cross the isthmus, and then get a second boat in
  the Pacific shore, or making the dangerous all-boat trip by Cape Horn. Each
  route has its dangers: Cholera might strike as you make your way across the
  Northern states or your boat might sink. As usual with Sierra adventures,
  instant killing happens if the player is careless, but will also happen at
  random. Other important (and innovative) concept is the game being timed. If
  Jerrod takes too long to leave Brooklyn, passages to California increase in
  price, and his house devalues."
