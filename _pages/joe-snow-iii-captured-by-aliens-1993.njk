description: "It's unclear who the aliens are and what they want, because we
  only have the title to go by, but they've got Joe and it's time for another
  round of platform jumping and treasure collecting.  Things do change this time
  around, however, since the thoughtful aliens have seen fit to provide Joe with
  a few new perks not present in the previous games: music, scrolling, and save
  slots. Thanks to the scrolling feature, the levels are larger and more
  abstract than before, and this time they're entered from an external
  \"overworld\"-type level (where the game can also be saved).  In contrast to
  the \"score as health\" system from the first two games, actual lives are
  used, so any contact with a fiery hazard will melt Joe down instantly...
  complete with a hissing sound effect."
