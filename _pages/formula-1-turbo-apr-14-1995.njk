description: "Composed of no more than 256 bytes of machine code, Formula-1
  TURBO is a straightforward, vertically-scrolling racer: the player's car zooms
  along at a constant speed and can be steered left and right to keep from
  crashing.  This can be achieved by avoiding two things - the sides of the
  road, and other cars; the latter are quite content to sit still in the middle
  of the track, indifferent to the prospect of being rear-ended. To complicate
  matters, the winding race track zig-zags left and right and grows
  progressively narrower, so that the difficulty ramps up as the game goes
  on.  Scoring increases with time, starting with \"A\" and progressing through
  consecutive letters - a longer survival ensures a place further along the
  alphabet."
