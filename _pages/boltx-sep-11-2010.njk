  Another wall demolition game inspired by Arkanoid, starring a movable paddle
  whose task is to deflect the always-moving ball and use it to smash as many
  bricks as possible.  Some bricks will yield the usual array of useful
  power-ups to be caught by the paddle; when you lose all your balls, the game
  is over. BOLTX offers four selectable game modes:

  Classic - the typical game with static level layouts: destroy everything to proceed from one level to the next.

  Infinite - plays like a single, continuous level; new lines of bricks appear regularly at the top, and the rest are pushed down.  If the bricks make it all the way to the bottom, you lose.

  2-Player - simultaneous Infinite mode: each player controls a paddle in a separate playfield.

  Duel - as above, but in "survival mode": if either player loses a ball, both playfields are reset, and the last man standing wins.

  All of the above are playable in four difficulty settings - simple, normal, hard and turbo, which determine the initial ball speed.  The game keeps a record of the top 8 scores (for Classic mode only), and the top player gets a verbal evaluation displayed under the title.
