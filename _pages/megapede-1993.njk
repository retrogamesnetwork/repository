description: In this clone of Centipede , the player controls a spaceship, which
  can move freely in the bottom third of the screen, and shoots upward to
  destroy the oncoming snake. The snake is made up of many segments, and when a
  section is separated from the rest of the body, its foremost segment becomes a
  head, forming a new snake. Scattered around the playfield are mushrooms and
  rocks, which can be destroyed by the player's shots. When the snake encounters
  one of these obstacles, it descends a row and reverses direction. Destroying a
  segment of the snake creates a mushroom, filling the playfield and causing the
  snake to descend more quickly. When the snake reaches the bottom of the
  screen, it gains armor, causing each segment to take two shots to kill,
  instead of one, and begins moving upward. Destroying a segment of the snake
  causes a gauge on the screen to climb. Once the gauge is filled, the player
  may use a single energized shot, which destroys every snake segment within
  range of the player. Also on the playfield is a spider, which descends toward
  the player, though it is slowed by obstacles. Killing the spider repeatedly
  will award the player an extra life, but the spider's speed increases each
  time it is killed. Its speed resets after the player is killed, or when a new
  level begins. Bonus levels appear after every third round, during which the
  player is assaulted by just the spider and bees, which descend toward the
  player more quickly, and are not slowed by obstacles. Like the spider, the
  bees move more quickly as they are killed. After the tenth level, bees begin
  to appear on the regular levels, in addition to the spider.
