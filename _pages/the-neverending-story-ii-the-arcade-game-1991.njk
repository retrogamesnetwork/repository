description: "The Neverending Story II is a platform game which is largely based
  on the movie. The concept is simple: you're Bastian, and are called forth once
  again by the Childlike Empress to save Fantasia, the Land of Dreams. The game
  itself is indeed a platformer where you have to outrun giants (as in the
  movie) or push them over ledges. With every level you will be awarded with
  another advancement in the plot, usually a few pages written on a \"book\"."
