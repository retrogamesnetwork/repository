description: Maelstrom is a managerial space strategy and simulation game. After
  the last great war, a small and previously unnoticed planet, Zokbar J, seized
  the opportunity and pounced on the broken pieces, creating the "Syndicate,"
  which now vies for domination of the galaxy.  You defected, and now control
  Harmony, a large Fitzholium miner, and can manage your planets' resources to
  build a fleet and defeat the Syndicate.
