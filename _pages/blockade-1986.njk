description: Blockade is a variation on the TRON -inspired Light Cycle concept,
  for 1 or 2 human players - computer-controlled rivals can join in for up to 6
  players in total.  Each player's objective is to block the others' paths with
  the trail left behind in their passage through the playfield - without running
  into their own trail, other players, or the boundary wall. A round is won when
  all opponents have been blockaded. Players are then scored according to their
  placements, and the next round begins; the first player to reach 100 points
  wins the game. Some parameters may be adjusted, including game speed,
  disappearing trails (for eliminated players), and the behavior of AI
  opponents.
