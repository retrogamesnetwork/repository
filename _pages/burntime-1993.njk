description: "Deserts cover the globe, cities are destroyed, the end of every
  civilization is near. The few survivors search for drinking water and food.
  They eat all they can find. Like a Role-Playing-Game, you travel through the
  world and meet many computer-played characters. You want to rule the world.
  But there are other 3 characters with the same aim. You spend the most game
  time looking at the map, which takes up several screens. The position of the 4
  characters, their occupied conquests, the cities, and the health condition of
  your character are shown on the map. The different settlements you can occupy
  are old factories, camping-grounds or ruins of old mega-cities. The five great
  cities are opened for all competitors and can‚Äôt be occupied. In these cities
  you cannot fight against your enemies. Sometimes you meet a human for changing
  news, items or take them in your party. There are different classes of
  computer-characters: fighters, engineers or doctors for example. Every
  character of your party can carry up to 6 items (food, weapons). These items
  are produced by the settlements you control."
