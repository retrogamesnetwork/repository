description: Alien Attack is an ASCII text game. You control a ship and have to
  destroy the alien fighters. The aliens will stop at nothing to destroy the
  Earth. Let one by and you lose. You have to be quick because the aliens come
  in sets of threes. After a little while, the speed of the game increases and
  you have to be fast because it gets faster and faster. You have to have good
  timing in this game because if you miss once in the fastest speed, you're
  done. There are no power-ups in this game. A high score table keeps track of
  the players' results.
