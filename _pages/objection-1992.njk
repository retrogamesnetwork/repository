description: In this legal simulation, the player is in charge of a defense
  attorney in a criminal trial, mounting relevant objections against the
  prosecution's badgering of a series of key witnesses toward issuing skewed
  testimony in a case against your defendant, accused of murdering one Sandra
  Stiff, a glamourous Beverly Hills heiress.  It is not enough to know when one
  may mount an objection, but specifically which from eleven different
  categories (from argumentative to hearsay to immaterial.  Once in a while a
  legitimate question comes through and the player still needs to identify it as
  a proper question!) This game has since been re-made for Windows with enhanced
  graphics and citation from case law.
