description: Super Huey UH-IX is a helicopter simulation game. You are the pilot
  of the experimental helicopter UH-1XA and you need to test it out in several
  game modes. In the flight school mode, you can learn how to fly. The computer
  will guide you through takeoff, flight, and landing. In reality mode, you will
  need to fly a mission to locate and bomb an enemy base and return home safely.
  The last mode is arcade mode where you have an unlimited amount of ammo to try
  and shoot down as many enemy aircraft as possible. The game is played from a
  first person view of the cockpit which is complete with radar and various
  instruments to help you fly.
