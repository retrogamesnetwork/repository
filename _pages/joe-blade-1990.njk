description: Tough guy Joe Blade must rescue six respected leaders from the
  madcap Crax Bloodfinger, who has kidnapped them in different areas of his
  base. Along the way he will find six bombs which must be activated, leaving
  him with only 20 minutes to rescue everyone. Joe Blade is viewed side-on and
  uses flick-screen progression. The bombs are deactivated by arranging letters
  into alphabetical order, but the bulk of the gameplay involves shooting and
  maze navigation. The screens are linked in various ways, and contain a number
  of keys which must be used correctly.
