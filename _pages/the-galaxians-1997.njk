description: The Galaxians is a freeware  clone of the classic shoot 'em up game
  Galaxian. The objective of the game is to achieve a high score. Gameplay is
  very much in the style of the old arcade games. The cursor keys move the
  player's ship from side to side while the Space bar fires the main weapon. The
  enemy ships, swoop around the screen as they attack. When a wave of enemy
  ships has been cleared the player starts again with the same ships in the same
  formation, effectively replaying the same level until all their ships are
  destroyed. The game is over when all the player's ships are destroyed. The
  game records only one high score. It is entirely keyboard controlled and can
  be played by one or two players.
