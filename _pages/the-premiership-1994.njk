description: A quite ordinary football management game similar to an early
  version of Championship Manager. Like Championship Manager it uses commentary,
  but highlights are showed using a graphical engine. The game offers you the
  opportunity to play any team in the English Premier League. You could choose
  to play with normal teams or to buy all your players from scratch.
