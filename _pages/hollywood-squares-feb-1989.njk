description: This is a GameTek conversion of the '80s version of the game show
  Hollywood Squares.  Two contestants play a version of tic-tac-toe, with
  "celebrities" filling in for the squares. The selected celeb is asked a
  question, answers it, and the contestant must agree or disagree with their
  answer. A correct guess captures that square.  After three games, the winning
  contestant picks a key and a car out of two separate pools, hoping to match
  the two up and win the car.
