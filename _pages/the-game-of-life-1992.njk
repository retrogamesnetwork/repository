description: "The Game of Life is a real-time puzzle game. Calling itself
  modestly \"the ultimate cell simulation\", the Game of Life tries to recreate
  the processes inside a simple organic structure. This body consists of five
  different types of cells: The proto cells (the \"flesh\") will grow quickly
  and aimless, unless you border them with skin. To control proto growth, you
  can install control cells; they consume energy produced by support cells.
  Sense cells will provide you with information about the well-being of your
  organic entity. The basic cells will grow all by themselves, but also rot if
  left unattended. Your task is control: Move or destroy unwanted cell blocks,
  build and link a power supply throughout the structure, prevent decay and (in
  later missions) virus attacks. There are 99 levels to fulfill. Early ones make
  you rebuild a given design; later on, you'll have to reach goals like a
  certain amount of energy stockpiled. The time for each mission is limited."
