description: A variation on the TRON -inspired Light Cycle concept; the action
  takes place in an arena where the player must steer the Laser Cycle, keeping
  away from the walls and dodging a series of homing missiles.  The craft leaves
  behind a laser trail, which can be transformed into an energy barrier for
  short sections to block the missiles. Energy barriers cost power, and
  collectible power pods restore it.  According to your chosen skill level, the
  pace gets faster as the game progresses and the missiles are guided more
  efficiently; the length of your energy barrier is reduced, power pods
  disappear faster, and the arena walls start closing in - quick reflexes will
  be required to survive.
