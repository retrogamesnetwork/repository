  Brain Artifice is a puzzle game in which the player needs to build
  combinations out of given blocks. While initially the combinations simply
  consist of the the same picture or colour, in later levels there are certain
  patterns to achieve. The blocks are initially divided over the playfield and
  after grabbing one of them, the player can move it freely over all the
  unoccupied space. If the block is near another block from the pattern - the
  detailed requirements change from level to level - it is stuck and can't be
  moved anymore. When a whole pattern is done, the stones transform into bricks
  so the player knows it is time to work with the rest of the stones. All this
  has to be done within a time limit, and unwinnable situations are entirely
  possible.

  The game features 100 levels which introduce additional gameplay elements over time, e.g. static blocks, blocks which change their colour or hidden blocks.
