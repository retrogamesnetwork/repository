description: "Gertrude's Secrets is, in brief, what you get when you take Warren
  Robinett's Adventure for the VCS (right down to the quacking dragon-duck!) and
  turn it into an educational object-sorting game for a younger audience than
  the earlier Robot Odyssey and Rocky's Boots. Gertrude is a benevolent goose
  who maintains what might be considered a dungeon: a complex of chambers
  containing puzzles which yield secrets -- treasures -- upon completion.  But
  instead of monsters, the rooms contain something much scarier to a child:
  education in the fields of logic, pattern-matching (of colours, shapes and
  textures) and sorting, categorized internally as Array Puzzles, Loop Puzzles
  and Train Puzzles. The player interacts with the game world by moving a cursor
  around the screen with keyboard or joystick, picking up and dropping objects
  in appropriate places to make things happen -- triggering puzzles or
  attempting to solve them.  The puzzles gradually ramp up in difficulty, and a
  wide selection of whimsical trophies are awarded.  To prolong gameplay
  enjoyment and the exploration of the play environment, Robinett's trademark
  easter eggs are in the eaves, as well as UI manipulation well before its time,
  allowing players to \"skin\" the game with different tilesets or manually edit
  individual tiles."
