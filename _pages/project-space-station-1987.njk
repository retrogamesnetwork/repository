description: "Project: Space Station casts the player into the role of a NASA
  Administrator, charged with the task of designing and building a space
  station. The project will span 15 years, during which time the player must
  plan shuttle launches, recruit personnel, manage the budget, conduct research
  and development and, of course, design and build the station. A very deep and
  involved game for such an early effort."
