description: Voyager is a first-person action game that challenges the player to
  explore the levels of an alien spacecraft's maze. The environments consist of
  corridors and rooms done with 3D vector graphics. The protagonist has to evade
  robots programmed to blast any intruders. To win, the player must destroy all
  power generators and escape (or hunt down and annihilate) the killer robots.
