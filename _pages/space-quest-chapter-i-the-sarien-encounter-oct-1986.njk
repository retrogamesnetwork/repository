description: "Roger Wilco is one of the most important men on the starship
  Arcada: he is the janitor! Just when he was doing what he does best (dozing
  off in a closet), the shrill sound of an alarm penetrated the air. Arcada is
  attacked by the evil Sariens! Before Roger realizes what is going on, he
  discovers that he is the only survivor. The Sariens have killed the entire
  crew and stolen the valuable Star Generator. Roger's immediate task is to find
  a way to leave Arcada, which is about to explode in fifteen minutes. And then
  he'll have to show the Sariens why they should never mess with brave
  intergalactic janitors! Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter is a humorous sci-fi
  adventure game made with Sierra's AGI engine. The gameplay is similar to that
  of King's Quest : the player navigates Roger around with arrow keys and
  interacts with the game world by typing commands. There are puzzles to solve
  and plenty of situations where the player will have to use his wit to save
  Roger from death."
