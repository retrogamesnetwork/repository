description: The ninja hero of the original Saboteur game has been killed, and
  his sister Nina is out to avenge this injustice. She has an array of kung-fu
  moves on offer, and must put them to use through 700 screens of action. The
  game design is very similar to the original, right down to the unusual
  background graphical style. The sections of the game are on multiple levels,
  separated mainly by ladders, and with lots of weapons and ammunition to pick
  up along the way. To beat the game you'll have to collect tapes and collect a
  14-part computer code.
