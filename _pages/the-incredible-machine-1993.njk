description: 'The Incredible Machine is a puzzle game where the player has to
  assemble a Rube Goldberg-type contraption to solve a simple puzzle. The game
  consists of a series of puzzles, each having a simple objective, such as "put
  the baseball into the basket" or "turn on the fan". To achieve this, the
  player is given a number of parts such as: balls, girders, rope, balloons,
  seesaws, cats or monkeys, and his job is to arrange and connect them on the
  playfield, so that, upon clicking the "start puzzle" button, the whole
  contraption activates and achieves the objective. For added difficulty, some
  puzzles have different gravity or air pressure from that of Earth. There is
  also a freeform mode where the player is given an unlimited number of parts to
  construct a machine of his own invention. The machines created this way can be
  saved to disk.'
