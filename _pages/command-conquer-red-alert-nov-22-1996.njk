description: "What if Hitler never existed? Einstein pondered the question and
  created a time-machine to eliminate Hitler as a young man, thus preventing
  World War II as history remembers it. However, Einstein stopped one evil only
  to create another - because Stalin's Soviet Union is now poised to conquer
  Europe... and Allies must stop them! Command & Conquer: Red Alert can be
  considered a prequel to Command & Conquer. Like its predecessor, it is a
  real-time strategy with an isometric semi-top-down perspective using 2D sprite
  graphics engine. The player takes control of either the Allies or the Soviets,
  as he battles for destiny of the planet. Gameplay features are similar to
  those of the previous game, including building a base with some defenses,
  massing units, harvesting resources, etc. The game has a variety of
  environments in its missions, adding some indoor missions that use only
  infantry units."
