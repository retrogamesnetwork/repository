description: A lone inventor comes up with an elegant mini radio control and
  camera system. Desperate to beat his rival, he races his application to the
  patent office by folding it into a paper airplane, then augmenting that plane
  with his new control device. Over seven levels, the player braves dangers and
  rides wind currents -- through air vents, across fields, and between racing
  automobiles. As the game progresses the airplane exhibits new powers and
  abilities, including bombs, rocket boosters, and missiles. Several game
  elements are taken from the author's previous game, Rocket (to which Paper
  Airplane is the registration bonus), such that Paper Airplane can be seen as a
  spin-off of or semi-sequel to that game.
