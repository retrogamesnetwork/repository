description: Plundered Hearts is a text adventure game set in the late 1600's.
  The player takes control of a young Englishwoman who finds out that her father
  is sick. In order to take care of him, she travels to the West Indies. But on
  the way her ship is attacked by pirates, and she is carried away by their
  captain. Though still determined to find and help her father, the young woman
  discovers that perhaps she may find romance where she least expected it.
