description: "A space shooter reminiscent of Computer Space : the player
  controls a starship and is free to move about a wrap-around playing field,
  using a physically realistic scheme of inertial thrust, while pursued by
  formations of enemy spacecraft. Thrust can be applied in any direction using
  the cursor keys, but ships may only fire to the left or right - the player is
  equipped with a long-range projectile, while the enemies sport short-range
  laser beams.  When an enemy ship is destroyed, a new one takes its place;
  formations may break up, regroup and strengthen in numbers as the game
  progresses.  Raising the skill level cranks up the game speed and provides for
  increasingly hectic action."
