description: The evil wizard Zaks has cast a spell on the peaceful Yolkfolk, and
  while many fell under his spell, others have other problems to deal with,
  including Dizzy, who saw his girlfriend Daisy kidnapped and taken hostage by
  Zaks, and it's up to him to restore the Yolkfolk to normal and rescue Daisy
  from the top of the Cloud Castle's tower. The most technically-advanced of
  Dizzy's adventure games in many ways, it was the only one to feature actual
  scrolling rather than a flick-screen system, the only one not to be released
  for the 8 bit computers the character originated on, the only one to originate
  on a console, as well as featuring many mini-games, such as Bubble Dizzy and
  an Operation Wolf clone. Gameplay involves walking Dizzy through the levels,
  picking up objects and using them to solve simple puzzles. There are plenty of
  tests of arcade skill along the way as well, as gaps must be jumped and
  baddies avoided - starting with a limited number of lives, the player can earn
  more by completing Theodore's puzzle. Before rescuing Daisy the player must
  capture all stars that unlock the gates of the tower. This game was later
  re-released on the NES with an updated Aladdin cart version. Updates include
  the number of collectible stars have increased from 100 stars to 250 stars,
  Dizzy now walks at a brisker pace, there are small terrain differences, some
  item placements have been rearranged, and the inventory system has become more
  simplified.
