description: Dunjax chronicles the exploits of a space-traveling adventurer who
  has just crashed his ship on a newly-discovered planetoid.  The uncharted
  sphere appears to have a breathable atmosphere and its own alien inhabitants;
  unfortunately, when the protagonist awakens from his daze, he finds that a
  crucial part of the ship's propulsion system has gone missing in action -
  stolen, or (worse yet) eaten, by the curious (or simply hungry?)
  natives.  Their tracks lead to a series of caves, which must be explored to
  find the missing part... hopefully in an undigested state. Our intrepid
  explorer is equipped with an automatic handgun and with levitation boots,
  which allow for extended jumping acrobatics. The caves can be explored in a
  quasi-open world fashion, and each one has an exit hidden somewhere within the
  maze of the dangerous chambers, locked doors, slanted chutes, rocky spikes and
  lava pools; many walls and floor tiles hide secret passages, which in some
  cases function as traps.  The hostile cave-dwellers do not enjoy human
  intrusions, and will attempt to take out the player by draining away his lives
  (which function as hit-points). The action is viewed from a side-scrolling 2D
  perspective, which considers the protagonist's vision - areas not in direct
  line-of-sight will remain in the dark until explored.  A password is provided
  at the end of each level, so that the game can always be continued from the
  next one.
