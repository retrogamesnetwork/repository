description: "Intergalactic hero Space Ace faces off against the evil Commander
  Borf, who hits him with an Infanto-Ray, turning Ace into an adolescent version
  of himself called Dexter. Now Ace/Dexter must not only rescue his girlfriend
  Kimberly but also prevent the destruction of the Earth at the hands of Borf.
  Readysoft's version of the laserdisc arcade game Space Ace for 16-bit
  computers follows the mold of their earlier Dragon's Lair adaptation: only
  selected scenes from the original game are used, with all the graphics redrawn
  from the original cel animation to fit the capabilities of the target
  machines. As in Dragon's Lair, the game consists of the cartoon movie running
  by itself, with the player being required to press the right button at the
  right time (either moving or firing Ace's gun) or see one of many death
  animations. The original arcade game offered some alternate paths through the
  game by letting the player choose between playing as Dexter or turning him
  back into Ace - the computer version is missing this option, and one always
  plays as Dexter or Ace depending on the scene."
