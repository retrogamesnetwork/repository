description: Berlin Wall is a shareware, two-player, strategy game whose
  game-play has elements similar to Tetris. It is entirely keyboard controlled.
  In this game the players are presented with tetris-like pieces that appear at
  either side of the play area. Using the keyboard they must place their pieces
  and build a vertical wall across the screen. When a solid line has been
  completed it is removed, the player who constructed it scores points, the
  remaining pieces shuffle along towards the centre of the screen and the game
  continues. It ends, as in a game of Tetris, when no new pieces can be placed
  onto the screen for one of the players. The game has ten levels of difficulty
  with each level introducing new shaped pieces. There is a high score table and
  optionally obstacles van be introduced into the game area to make wall
  construction more difficult. Additionally the game speed can be varied and the
  action keys can be redefined.
