description: "A single-screen, text-mode take on the BurgerTime formula: your
  task is to prepare oversized hamburgers by walking your character over the
  ingredients, which causes them to drop on top of each other, one platform at a
  time.  If you can assemble four finished burgers at the bottom of the screen,
  you'll be praised by your boss -- and hopefully ascend from Hamburger Hell to
  Hamburger Heaven. However, your job is complicated by supernatural
  intervention: the burger parlor is haunted by a ghost.  Perhaps fast-food
  cosmology also includes a Hamburger Limbo, and this apparition is a former
  employee who perished in a horrible burger-flipping accident; whatever it
  might be, it stalks the ladders and platforms at random, seeking to take you
  down with it.  If you fail to evade this paranormal pursuer five times, your
  kitchen career will be finished."
