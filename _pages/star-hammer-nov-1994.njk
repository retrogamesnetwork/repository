description: You could think of Star Hammer as Wing Commander in 2D. You are the
  pilot of a combat space ship which has to destroy enemies or protect friendly
  shuttles. The game features 40 linear missions with the main goal to defeat an
  enemy alien race. In a topdown perspective you steer the ship through the
  space and shoot at enemies. Your ship has different weapons and a shield which
  decreases when enemies hit your ship. On the upper left corner is a mini map
  which shows friend and foe. Several in vector graphics animated cutscenes play
  during the campaign.
