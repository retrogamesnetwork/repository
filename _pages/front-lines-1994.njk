description: Front Lines is a tactical wargame of the "near" future  (set in
  2020 or 2044, depending on whether you play the U. S. or German version). It
  can run in either single-player or two-player mode, and can use a head-to-head
  feature by modem. All the usual forces of the modern army are present, but by
  this time heavy laser weapons have become practical, soldiers wear powered
  armor, unmanned ground strike aircraft are common, tanks can hover as well as
  roll, and artillery projectiles are even more powerful and accurate than they
  are today. You command your army, which may incorporate some U. S. forces, in
  the European theater. Some of the opposing forces answer to a corporate
  conglomerate.  The roles of offensive, defensive, and supply assets have to
  balanced properly. The game progresses through a series of land battles over
  various kinds of terrain -- and the terrain gives varying combinations of
  advantages and disadvantages. The game has some limited representation of
  Europe's real-world geographical features, which gives a sense of why they are
  militarily important. For example, you can see the importance of the Fulda
  Gap, just as it was important in previous World Wars, and just as it would
  have been important if the Cold War had become hot. Each battle has one or
  more objectives, and also a time limit. To win, you must accomplish your
  objectives while stopping the enemy from accomplishing his, and you must do
  this before time runs out.  Each objective accomplished earns you a certain
  number of victory points.  At the battle's end, the winner is the player with
  the most victory points.
