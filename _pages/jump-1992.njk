description: This arcade game is a cross between Breakout and Space Invaders.
  Player controls an electromechanical robot, who walks along the top of a wall
  consisting of bricks and jumps on it. A line of bugs is coming to him from the
  bottom of the screen in vertical direction, while the bomb is flying in
  horizontal direction in the center. Bugs may be killed by jumping on the wall,
  which results in a brick falling from its bottom. The number of jumps is equal
  to the bottom brick's distance from the robot. Flying bomb may eliminate the
  brick until it reaches the bug, but if the bug is killed, its bad or good soul
  will fly to the top, where robot may collect it and make influence on his
  mood. After the bug is eliminated, another one will start to crawl from the
  bottom. There is a snail moving in horizontal direction at the very bottom of
  the screen, which is mostly covered by the bugs crawling to the top, and it
  may be hit by brick in case of success also. The player is transferred to
  another level after necessary quantity of the bugs is killed. But beware!
  Robot's energy is exhausted, when bug is crawling upon him, and the robot
  becomes non-functional if the bugs reached the very top of the screen or if
  the robot falls off the wall.
