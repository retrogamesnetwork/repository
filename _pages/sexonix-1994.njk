description: XoniX games are generally a spin off from Taito's Qix , in which
  the player traces outlines on a flat playfield, avoiding being touched by
  enemies while vulnerable tracing, and tries to close off complete rectangular
  portions of the screen.  Early versions would "fill in" completely-traced
  areas with geometric patterns, but sooner or later some cloner would hit on
  the notion that there are some background images players would find even more
  pleasant -- here, as you might have guessed by the game's name, what the
  player gradually reveals are images of attractive women in compromising
  positions.
