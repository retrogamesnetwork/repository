description: The Enigma Of Ashrella is a BBS Door, text based, role-playing
  game. In the world of Daagrung lies the continent of Ashrella. Named after the
  Goddess of the Harvest, Ashrella is a peaceful and prosperous land or at least
  it was until the creatures came. No-one knows where they come from but they
  destroy crops, kill, rob and disappear. It's the player's task to end this
  plague. Upon entering the game the player is presented with an outline of the
  story, they then enter their game-name and are rewarded with another piece of
  the story and some instructions before choosing their class and setting their
  player stats. Ashrella is/was an on-line world which had no non playing
  characters, at least that was the case in version 2.0 beta, so players had to
  interact with each other in order to make progress and explore the world. Gold
  is important here, it could be earned by killing creatures, by gambling, or by
  selling items such as gems or flowers. Alliances could be made and enemies
  could be destroyed by sending disease, curses or assassins after them. The
  game is composed of a several of chapters and it was reckoned that it would
  take about a week to complete a sub-chapter and defeat its boss, and about a
  month to complete a whole chapter.
