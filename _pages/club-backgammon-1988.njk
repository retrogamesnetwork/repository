description: Club Backgammon is a computer adaptation of the board game that can
  be played by two human players or by one human against three levels of AI.
  It's also possible to watch a game between two AI controlled players. The game
  follows the rules of the original board game and is played with a cursor that
  is used to click on the board to move around pieces and to throw the dices.
  Some additional options exist to customize the game such as editing the colors
  of board, pieces and dices as well as lowering the speed. It is also possible
  to turn on manual roll which means the player is allowed to enter his own dice
  values. Another feature is the possibility to see an evaluation of a player's
  position. This shows the number of points each player is away from bearing
  off, an evaluation of the blots that a player has showing and the number of
  moves the other player can make. A practice menu allows the player to edit the
  game board by moving the pieces into any legal position. There is also an
  option to reverse sides which means the player swaps pieces with the AI
  opponent.
