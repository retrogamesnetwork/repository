description: "Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is an arcade action game
  where you take control of the Starship Enterprise. Your mission is to save the
  Federation from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll
  have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple
  rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter
  saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of
  depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has
  completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an
  unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each
  round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of
  your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is
  played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person
  view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the
  screen is a first person point of view"
