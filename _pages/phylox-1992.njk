description: >-
  Phylox is a single player sci-fi shareware shooter. Those silly scientists
  have been at it again, tampering with nature. This time they have genetically
  modified insects  and the mutations have established themselves in an
  underground network of tunnels. In this underground fortress dwells their
  leader, Phylox with its breeding chambers.

  The player takes on the role of Retrox, a lone hero who flies down these tunnels armed with a laser and a grenade launcher to do battle with the insect hordes. The game is keyboard or joystick controlled.
