description: Crystal Ball is a shareware program that makes predictions about
  the future! This game features two modes. In the first mode, you may select
  from a list of predefined questions to see what the crystal ball thinks will
  happen. Political elections, the future of science, and advances in health and
  education are among the topics that can be selected. The second variation lets
  you type in your own questions that you would like a prediction on. In either
  case, the crystal ball will spend a few moments thinking and then display its
  prediction. You may choose to save predictions to disk, or print them out.
  Also included is a vocabulary editor which allows you to edit all of the words
  available to the crystal ball.
