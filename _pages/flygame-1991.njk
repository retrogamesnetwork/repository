description: Flygame is a single-player, freeware, adware game from MorrafWare.
  It was issued so that other companies could put their name on it and give it
  to customers as a freebie or use it to attract customers to their site. The
  player controls an aircraft on the left of the screen. They must guide it over
  a scrolling landscape avoiding any mountains. The only controls are the U & D
  keys for Up and Down.
