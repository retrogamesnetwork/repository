description: 'The year 1942 is the subject of many computer games that deal with
  World War II. The reason: this was the year that many pivotal battles were
  fought including Midway, Stalingrad, N. Africa, and... Guadalcanal. This game
  deals with the desperate battles fought in the Solomon Islands, specifically
  in and around the island of Guadalcanal, in which the Allies tried to stop the
  Japanese from their drive to Australia. In TF42, you can play as either the
  Americans or Japanese. All the major ships that participated are represented,
  including the infamous Yamato and devastating Iowa. It features individual
  historical battles, as well as the whole Guadalcanal Campaign. The objective
  in the Campaign is to take over both bases on Guadalcanal, but as you are the
  Naval commander, you do not have direct control over the land battle. Your
  main objective is to keep the marines on Guadalcanal supplied and bring
  reinforcements to them, to shell the enemy base, and to stop the enemy from
  bringing supplies and reinforcements to their troops. These 3 tasks are
  accomplished by assigning the ships available to you into Task Forces and Task
  Groups, and send them on Patrol, Supply, and Bombard missions. More ships
  become available as time progresses. The game has a strategic mode in which
  you can order your fleets around and monitor the overall situation, and a
  tactical mode in which two fleets meet and you can actually command the battle
  in real-time and "jump into" any ship and fire the guns or torpedos. You also
  have air support. The planes can patrol or, if you have fighters/dive
  bombers/torp bombers available, attack enemy fleets! The air units and amounts
  of planes available to you change as they did in the actual war. You can
  create your own "Dream Matchups": Yamato vs. Iowa; North Carolina vs. Nagato;
  A group of New Orleans Heavy Cruisers vs. small but fast and deadly
  torpedo-armed Japanese destroyers... all the ships are available.'
