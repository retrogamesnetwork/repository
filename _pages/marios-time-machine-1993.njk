description: Bowser is at it again!  He's using a time machine, called a
  Timulator, to loot historical artifacts from the past, in order to stock his
  museum.  He plans to destroy the time machine after, and therefore change the
  course of history forever.  It's up to Mario to stop Bowser and return all the
  stolen artifacts to their rightful place in history!
