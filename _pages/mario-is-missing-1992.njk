description: Bowser, the token bad guy from the Mario Bros. series, is up to no
  good again in this educational game designed to teach children geography. This
  time he's set up his headquarters in Antarctica and created portals to 25
  famous cities around the world, so that his Koopas can wreak havoc in our own
  world. He's also kidnapped Mario, hence the title of this game. You play as
  Luigi who must foil Bowser's plans by entering through each of the portals,
  tracking down the Koopas who have stolen famous artifacts, and looking for
  clues about your location. Once you've set everything right and determined
  where you are, you call Yoshi on your Globulator so he can track you down. You
  need Yoshi's help to eat the Pokey (a cactus-like creature) that's guarding
  the return portal, and when Luigi returns he can close the portal forever. By
  exploring these 25 cities, children can familiarize themselves with the
  landmarks and artifacts that each city has. When Luigi returns the stolen
  artifacts to the proper places he can even take photographs of them. There is
  also an add-on disk you can purchase that adds ten additional cities to the
  game.
