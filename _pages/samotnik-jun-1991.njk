description: Samotnik is an adaptation of the Peg Solitaire board game. The
  action takes place on a standard 8x8 chessboard of 32 figures set in all areas
  of the same color. All figures are the same. The main task is to remove all of
  the figures, with the exception of one. Hitting a pawn, as in checkers,
  involves skipping the whipped figure diagonally. It is possible to capture
  only one pawn in one movement. The first movement is based solely on any
  figure you choose to be removed. Hitting also allows moving pawns. The game
  ends when there is no possibility of movement. Victory occurs when the board
  only holds one figure. The program stores all the moves made ‚Äã‚Äãsince the
  beginning of the game. It is possible to undo the move and replay the entire
  game.
