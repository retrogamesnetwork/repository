description: "Greedy gives Pac-Man an enhanced makeover, even while retaining
  the core concept: fill your bottomless appetite by cleaning out mazes full of
  dots, while evading the pursuing ghosts.  The power pellets still allow our
  hero to top the food-chain for a limited time and hunt down the enemies, but
  dozens of other power-ups are new on the menu - from speed changes to
  invincibility, score multipliers, wildcards and a random bonus slot
  machine.  There are power-downs, too, which invert your controls, stop you
  from eating, and cause other assorted mischief. The yellow, rotund eater is
  armed with a limited (but rechargeable) speed booster, and can gain extra
  lives by completing matching groups of colorful crystals.  Different speed and
  skill settings can be selected; every level boasts a completely new maze
  layout, and the DOS version complements this with a fully-functional level
  editor to customize things even further."
