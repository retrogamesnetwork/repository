description: "The ever-popular card game receives another computerized
  treatment, this time at Buck Mann's casino.  The player gets the option to cut
  the deck, places a bet, and the basic rules apply: five cards are dealt, and
  any of them may be replaced once to get a better hand.  Hands are ranked in
  standard order - one pair, two pair, three of a kind, straight, flush, full
  house, four of a kind, straight flush; achieving one of these will return or
  multiply your bet accordingly. Here, aces are always high; after each hand you
  get the chance to bet on the next card's value, double or nothing.  If you go
  broke, you can either see \"Sharky\" for a loan... or get a less-than-friendly
  farewell from the staff.  You may open an account with the casino to have your
  player stats saved to disk (using the same player name in a later session will
  retrieve them)."
