description: In this out-of-canon adventure of gamebook hero Kai Master Lone
  Wolf, the player controls the dashing adventurer scaling the interior of
  warlock Gorazh's sinister magic tower Kazan-Gor -- an inverted pyramid,
  broadening as it gets higher -- in pursuit of a Lorestone of Nyxator located
  at the very top.  Imprisoned in his flick-screen tower, Gorazh has filled it
  with monsters and traps, the most insidious of which was a magic mirror,
  Dhazag-Oud, whose seven shards reflect back superior counterparts of whoever
  gazes upon them (and which subsequently result in boss battles.) The gameplay
  largely skips over the choose-your-own-adventure sequences of Lone Wolf's
  gamebook roots and instead just initially prompts the player to select four of
  eight Kai skills (eg. Mindshield, Sixth Sense, Healing) to use (with
  restrictions) over the course of his tower travails.  From there, the player
  controls Lone Wolf's movements, skill use and attack strategies using the
  keyboard controls.
