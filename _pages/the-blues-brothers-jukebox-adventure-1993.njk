description: Jukebox Adventure is the sequel to The Blues Brothers. Once again,
  the player has to choose a favourite Blues Brother and take him through
  different side-scrolling platform levels. He needs to collect records and use
  them as defence by throwing them towards enemies. There are also power-ups
  that can be gathered until the jukebox to progress to the next level is found.
