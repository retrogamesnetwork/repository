description: Fly as an American or Japanese pilot in one of 4 operations in the
  Pacific Theatre during WWII. This simulation can also qualify as educational
  software because the manual features tons of historical information. Twelve
  aircraft (including variants) and about 20 types of ships are represented.
  First of the Lucasfilm/Lawrence Holland WWII air combat trilogy.
