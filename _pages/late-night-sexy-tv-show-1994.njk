description: "Late Night Sexy TV Show is an adult-oriented quiz show with dating
  sim elements. The goal of the player is to become the soulmate of one of the
  three other contestants. To do so, he or she must: (a) learn the other
  contestant's tastes and preferences, and (b) earn enough money to purchase
  items or upgrades that match those preferences. Money is primarily earned by
  correctly answering general knowledge questions, which can be picked from a
  variety of subjects including literature, films, biology, martial arts,
  etiquette and religion. Once an answer is given, no matter whether it was
  correct or not, the player can try and get to know another player's basic
  tastes, such as in music, books or favorite color. However, if the question
  was answered correctly, the player is also allowed to make a \"decision\".
  Possible decisions include: (1) asking another player more intimate questions
  concerning, for example, the looks of their Mr. or Mrs. Right; (2) gambling
  part of the cash reserve; (3) advancing in a career that appeals to the other
  player; (4) buying upgrades in shops that range from clothing to plastic
  surgery to real estate. Each player also has a limited amount of
  \"boomerangs\", which allow them to skip answering a particularly difficult
  question. The contestant who first becomes a perfect match wins. The entire
  game is presented as a TV show, complete with musical interludes, commercials
  and comments from viewers. Any of the four contestants can be played by human
  players taking turns."
