description: "CRW Metal Jacket is a mecha strategy game set in futuristic Japan.
  You command a group of well-armed soldiers through a series of missions, from
  infiltrating a drug lord's mansion to assassinating the leader of a coup. The
  game proceeds in real-time, but you can pause the action at any time to give
  orders for your soldiers to move or attack. Your units can pilot one of three
  specialized mechs: Attacker, Defender, or Sniper, and your squad leader Reiko
  has an exclusive Commander mech. Each mech has a special move in addition to
  attacking or defending, such as the Defender's Search, which reveals a small
  area of the map from the fog of war. After each mission, all of your surviving
  soldiers earn bonus points, which can be distributed among their stats. If you
  fail a mission, you proceed to the next, but receive no bonus points, making
  all future missions harder. The game was released in Japan on the PC-98, then
  localized for China and Korea on DOS. The game was remade for the PlayStation
  two years later as the similarly-named CRW: Counter Rebellion War, with
  controls adapted to the game pad and four additional missions."
