description: "Crown is a jump and run game. The goal is to travel trough six
  different countries to finally become king. The game is non-linear, so the
  player can choose which country he wants to go to. The levels are pretty
  different: in England, you need to control a knight on his horse. You need to
  jump over all hurdles and collect all 80 shields to complete the level. In
  Scandinavia, you control a Viking on his boat. Here you need to collect
  treasure chests and avoid the whales crossing your way. In Russia, you play a
  Russian bear who needs to imitate the dance of a girl next to him. If he
  succeeds, the bystanders will give him money. In Japan, you control a small
  dragon which needs to jump from island to island. On his way, he needs to
  collect 80% of the stuff floating around or he will starve to death. In India,
  the small Indian boy needs to walk over the bridge, avoiding the flying
  bananas (?) and catch 8 mice. And finally, in Arabia, you control a dude on a
  flying carpet who needs to catch at least 50% of the flying lamps to stay on
  his carpet."
