description: Deep Fortress is a shareware side-scrolling shooter. The player
  controls a helicopter and must fight through heavy defences of a fortress to
  rescue captured high command officials who are held inside. The player's
  helicopter has several powerful weapons, including a machine gun and several
  types of missiles. All weapons share the same ammo pool, with each weapon
  requiring a certain amount of ammo per shot. Ammunition can be replenished by
  picking powerups scattered through the level. Armour is repaired in the same
  fashion. There are seven levels in the game, with only the first level
  available in the shareware version. In each level, the player's mission is to
  storm one of the fortress' bunkers and destroy the shield generator, gaining
  access to the next bunker. Opposing forces include enemy helicopters, ground
  vehicles and troops.
