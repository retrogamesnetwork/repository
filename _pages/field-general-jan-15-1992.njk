description: Field General is an American Pro Football game for one or two
  players. The game is entirely keyboard controlled. The player(s) name their
  teams and can either direct all elements of the play themselves or they can
  opt to have the teams play automatically. This game is not a management game,
  there's no player's draft, no financial juggling, none of that sort of stuff.
  The key, and allegedly unique, feature of this game is that both teams start
  off equal and it is the player(s) ability in calling the plays that decides
  who is victorious.
