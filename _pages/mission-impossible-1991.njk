description: "Mission: Impossible is an adventure game that puts you in command
  of a 4-man spy team. You can control separate members, ordering them to do
  different things at once. Some of the things you can do include tracking
  suspects, tapping phones, infiltrating terrorist offices, etc. The game
  features a vast overhead map, real-time progression, and light role-playing
  elements manifested in the agents' unique personal parameters."
