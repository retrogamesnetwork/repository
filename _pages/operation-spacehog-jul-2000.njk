description: Operation Spacehog is a classic 2D side scrolling shoot'em up where
  players have to blast their way through space defending mother Earth from evil
  invading aliens. Three different pilots with their own characteristics can be
  selected from which adds some replayability. For each completely destroyed
  wave of enemies a power up token is awarded which can be used to but extra
  equipment for the craft like more fire power, heat seeking missiles, etc.
  Additionally, the game also supports for two simultaneous players for extra
  competitive action.
