description: Moraff's Revenge is the first of Moraff's classic dungeon crawls.
  Choose to be a fighter or a wizard. The player runs about in four-color
  dungeons, returning to the top of the dungeon every once and awhile to climb
  up ropes into shops and inns. The game features a map which fills in as more
  territory is explored. The "Beginner's Version" includes 17 levels before
  registering to have the full 70 levels available for play.
