description: "This computerized variant of baseball - itself based on an older
  BASIC adaptation from 1973 - delivers the sport to your computer screen using
  nothing but text.  The computer and the player get to manage rival teams, and
  flip a coin for the home position.  All input consists of numbers: when the
  player's team takes the field, possible throws for the pitcher are numbered 1
  through 7 (fast ball, curve, slider, sinker, change-up, knuckleball,
  screwball).  When the team is up to bat, possible actions are 1 through 4
  (batter takes pitch, batter swings away, batter bunts, lead runner steals - if
  one is on base).  The results of each move are described on screen, and after
  each half-inning the scoreboard is updated."
