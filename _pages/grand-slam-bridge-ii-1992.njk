description: The second installment in the series is a remake of Grand Slam
  Bridge with modern abilities of its time such as VGA graphics, music and
  animations. It represents a card game Bridge with rules of Contract Bridge.
  For both partners a set of bidding conventions, which include Cue Bid, Weak
  Two-Bid, 5 Card Major, 4 Card Major, Jacoby Transfer, Gambling NT, and Unusual
  NT, may be adjusted. The game progress may be saved/restored. Overall
  statistics for each player in the system are stored and may be displayed. The
  multiple options allow to adjust the gameplay such as rotate the table or
  change the TableTop, adjust conventions, give certain cards to certain hands
  to simulate some cases, set the hands visibility, choose the human/computer
  player for each hand, etc. Hints, tutorial, and help on playing the Bridge are
  also provided. The game is allowed for up to 4 human players.
