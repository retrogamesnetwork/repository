description: Super Maxit is a shareware, player vs computer, strategy game. The
  game is played out on a board which is divided into squares, there are
  different board shapes available but they all play the same. Each cell
  contains a number in the range plus thirty through to minus thirty. The
  players select a cell and press ENTER to get that number added to their score.
  The twist is that the player can only select a cell on the current row, via
  the left/right arrow keys, while the computer can only select a cell on the
  current column. The game has an in-game help function, a hint, undo and a
  cheat function, a demo mode and optional sound.
