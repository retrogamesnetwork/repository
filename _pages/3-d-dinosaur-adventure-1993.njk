description: 3-D Dinosaur Adventure is an educational game about the many types
  of dinosaurs from Earth's past. As the title suggests, the game has several
  areas that make use of the included blue-red 3-D glasses that make the
  dinosaurs appear to leap off the computer screen. Kids can learn using the
  reference encyclopedia section to explore when or where the dinosaurs lived,
  how they evolved, and what survival methods they used. The title has several
  learning activities that take advantage of the wealth of fossil photo records
  and illustrations for visual recognition of dinosaurs. It also has a movie
  theater that shows the dinosaurs' anatomy so that the kids understand the
  biology of the creatures. The 3-D museum allows you to walk around in a
  virtual museum, using your 3-D glasses to really bring impact to the creatures
  as they pop off the screen. The game layout is stylized like a theme park, and
  has four main areas to explore with hidden items to find and experience.
