description: Latverian president Dr. Doom is a terrible enemy, so when he
  hatches a plan to blow up New York City with a stolen Atomic bomb, one Marvel
  superhero is not enough to stop him. As the lavishly-drawn comic bundled with
  the game explains, Spider-Man and Captain America must join forces to go to
  Latveria and foil his plans. The main action in the game is a side-scrolling
  beat 'em up, in which you alternately control the two characters. They each
  have their own moves to deal with The Rhino, Electro and other foes. Moves are
  context-sensitive based on the distance between your character and the
  opponent. Energy bars decrease as you each take hits. After each section you
  get comic-book sequences as a reward, and to set the scene of the evolving
  story.
