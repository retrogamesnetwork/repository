description: Bandits! is a shareware shoot 'em up arcade style game for one
  player that is a bit of a cross between Galaxian and Space Invaders. The
  object of the game is to achieve a high score. Game play is very much in the
  Space Invaders style as  the left / right cursor keys being used to move the
  player's ship from side to side while the Space bar fires the ship's weapon.
  The enemy ships, however, attack in the style of the enemies in Galaxian,
  swooping around the screen as they attack. The game maintains a high score
  table and entirely controlled via the keyboard.
