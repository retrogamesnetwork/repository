description: "This educational game teaches children about mammals and about
  logic and language skills by utilizing 5 decoder alphabets: English, American
  Sign Language, Braille, Morse Code, and Semaphore. You play as a C.Y.P.H.E.R.
  (Courageous Young Partners in Hush-Hush Electronic Radiotelegraphy) who must
  locate and decode CYPHERGRAMS and then deliver them to your client.  Since you
  are an agent for Operation Wildlife the secret messages will involve a variety
  of clues about mammals.  Agents must beware of L.U.R.K.'s (Loathsome
  Underhanded Rotten Krooks) who will try to steal the CYPHERGRAMS. Players will
  learn about 87 mammals and their habitats and will also be able to access the
  built in FunCyclopedia, which contains over 1,000 facts about mammals.  In
  addition, basic cryptography is taught with the 5 decoder alphabets. Players
  can select from 4 levels of difficulty."
