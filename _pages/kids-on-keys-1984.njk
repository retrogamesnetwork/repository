description: This is a collection of three mini-games designed to drill in some
  basic reading and typing skills to the young microcomputer user of the early
  '80s.  The first of the three games (each with four skill levels, demanding
  faster reflexes) presents the player with falling letters which must be typed
  correctly before hitting the bottom of the screen... and eventually the game's
  mascot floats down defying the player to type in an entire word.  The second
  game takes word-typing as a given skill, as the player is now in charge of
  typing in the full names of icons of common household objects gradually
  floating down the screen.  In the third game, an object is named on the bottom
  of the screen and the player must punch in the correct number corresponding to
  the object's icon, displayed on screen. The second and third games have bonus
  rounds whose gameplay is as the regular rounds, except that the icons are now
  partially obscured, demanding a certain exercise of player memory faculties.
