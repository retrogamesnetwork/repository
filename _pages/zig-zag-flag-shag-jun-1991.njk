description: Zig Zag Flag Shag contains ten puzzles in which the goal is to move
  from the left side of a seven by twelve grid to a specific space containing a
  flag located off of the right side of the grid.  To accomplish this goal, the
  player can move orthogonally or by using chess-style knight moves.  To make
  things more challenging, the player has a limited number of moves in each
  direction (which varies from level to level and by difficulty
  setting).  Additionally, some puzzle squares contain stop signs (which force
  the player to start over) or arrows (which automatically move the player to
  another square). The game also features synthesized speech through the PC
  speaker.
