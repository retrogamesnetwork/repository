description: Captain Kang is a platform shooter starring the titular character,
  a kangaroo who also happens to be a special agent sent on a mission to protect
  a city populated by anthropomorphic animals from a monster assault. The
  Captain is equipped with his default laser pistol at all times. He can shoot
  in two directions, jump, and duck. Kang's health is measured by a bar with
  separate units; collecting a sufficient amount of giant pills and other items
  scattered through the stages will refill a portion of the bar. Temporary
  invincibility power-up is also available. The stages are fairly vast and may
  offer optional routes to the destination.
