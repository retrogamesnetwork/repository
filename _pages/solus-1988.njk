description: Solus is a sci-fi text adventure game. The story begins when you
  wake up six months before schedule due sound of the computer alarm. After
  leaving the cryogenic chamber the first task is to find out what happened. The
  main computer report says about small gelatinous creatures, which are
  responsible for violating the integrity of some of the tunnels, allowing
  pressure to escape and the native atmosphere to enter.
