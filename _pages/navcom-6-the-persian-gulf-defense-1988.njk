description: Commanding a Naval Cruiser, you must work to protect the waters in
  the Persian Gulf.  There are three missions to choose from, Convoy Escort,
  Patrol, or Dawn of Death. If you choose Convoy Escort, you'll need to protect
  the convoy from any enemies deciding to attack the convoy.  Or patrol the
  waters and destroy all enemies you find.  Enemies can be other ships, jets, or
  even mines.  Just be sure not to shoot the good guys.
