description: Odysseus Kent, an odd little fellow is searching for the Lost
  Treasure of Randolph McBoing (all based on a map he got from a shadowy guy at
  the bus stop). Equipped with a trusty shovel and treasure map, the would-be
  treasure hunter braves the cold and darkness to the supposed site where the
  treasure lies...at the cemetery in the courtyard of the local church. Suddenly
  out of the darkness, a mysterious figure appears with a cursing eye! Just his
  luck, he's caught red-handed by the local priest...Oh, well. Now, he has to
  find access the hard way, since the priest isn't hiring any novice grave
  diggers. Another freeware game by Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw is a small but
  humorous adventure game similar to the likes of Monkey Island (you'll notice
  the resemblance when our hero talks). The game, like most 3rd Person adventure
  games, consists of action buttons which you use to interact with your
  surrounding. Simple as it is, it has your standard Look, Use, Talk, Inventory
  features.
