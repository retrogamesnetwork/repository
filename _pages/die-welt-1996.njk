description: In this advergame for a German newspaper of the same name your job
  as a paperboy is to deliver newspapers to the subscripers living in a
  residential street. You¬¥re using your bycicle to ride to the postboxes of the
  customers and throw them into them. This is done by riding over a blue symbol
  triggering the throw automatically. There are also obstacles to be encountered
  like parking cars or children kicking balls onto the road. The further you are
  riding the faster your ride will get. The game features a High Score list
  where you can enter your name when you were good enough.
