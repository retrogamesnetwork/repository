description: "BattleTech: The Crescent Hawks' Revenge is the sequel to
  BattleTech: The Crescent Hawk's Inception. It is the year 3029 during the
  Succession Wars; as the nineteen-year-old Mechwarrior Jason Youngblood of the
  Lyran Commonwealth (House Steiner), it is time to strike back at the
  treacherous forces of the Draconis Combine (House Kurita), who captured
  Jason's father in the original BattleTech, and whom he has sworn to rescue.
  Unlike its predecessor, the game inclines more towards RTS (real-time
  strategy) than role-playing gameplay style. The player will lead the forces of
  31st Century BattleMechs (Warrior Robots) in a daring mission of rescue and
  revenge. The game consists of two parts -  the storyline, which gives the
  player guidance and direction, and changes with the outcome of every decision
  made; and the scenarios, which are the arenas where the player watches his/her
  maneuvers unfold in real time. The game has digital speech and a technically
  advanced musical score."
