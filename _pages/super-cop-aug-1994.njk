description: Super Cop is a Korean-made platform shooter similar to early Duke
  Nukem platformers. The player controls a boy who has miraculously turned into
  a super-cop and must traverse hostile areas to defeat monsters and evil
  mechanical creatures. The game's visual style is fairly colorful, and many of
  the enemies are anthropomorphic animals. The player must complete eight
  platforming stages. A fixed amount of key items (such as floppy disks) must be
  collected in each stage in order to proceed to the next one. A boss enemy
  normally holds a number of such items and drops them upon defeat. The
  protagonist can only use one weapon, a gun with unlimited ammunition, but it
  can be upgraded twice for laser attack and fire bursts. It is possible to
  shoot horizontally and upwards, but not downwards or diagonally. Security
  camera and supply crates can be destroyed; the latter usually contain
  score-increasing or health-restoring items.
