description: "Captain Spleen is a planet-hopping comedy sci-fi adventure game.
  It uses keyboard input, but not for typing commands, only for selecting from
  option menus. The PC speaker is used for sound. In the introduction, we learn
  that our hero Captain Spleen is in debt and needs to pay off his loans. The
  starting location is McScotty's, a fast-food space station. Once we leave,
  there is a main menu of options: we can choose where to go to next from a list
  of seven destinations, change the speed that Captain Spleen's ship is
  travelling at, see a listing of current cargo, communicate with any nearby
  ships, activate weapons systems, and save/load the game."
