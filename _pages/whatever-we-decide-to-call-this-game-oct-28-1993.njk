description: "Whatever We Decide to Call this Game is a text adventure game
  where you play the role of a freshman arriving at Tumbulgum University, on
  your first day. As the introduction explains, there are three seemingly-simple
  tasks you must complete by the end of your first day: enroll yourself in
  classes, get a parking sticker, and find a bathroom. You begin outside the
  imposing entrance of the university's administration building, but to succeed
  in your quest you will need to find and explore various other buildings across
  the campus."
