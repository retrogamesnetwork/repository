description: Based on events from the Robotech animated series, the crustacean
  Invid have invaded the Earth and set up a base of operations, code-named
  Reflex Point.  Holed up inside is the Invid Prince, who must be defeated to
  ensure the destruction of the base. As a freedom fighter, you will make use of
  the multiform vehicles familiar from the series - the Cyclone, a futuristic
  motorcycle that converts into a powered armor suit, and the Alpha, an
  aerospace fighter that morphs into a robotic form.  Various stages will be
  encountered en route to Reflex Point; at the beginning, you'll have to avoid
  pitfalls while traveling by Cyclone, and switch to first-person armor mode in
  order to chase off Invid troopers.  Once you get to your Alpha mecha, a short
  but perilous flight will take you to the enemy base, where you will have to
  pierce the laser barrier and face off against the Prince.
