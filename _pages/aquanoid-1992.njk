description: Aquanoid is a straight Breakout variant. The player controls a
  paddle which is positioned at the bottom of the screen and can move left and
  right. At the upper part of the screen are a variety of blocks and the goal is
  to destroy them all by bouncing a ball between the blocks and the paddle -
  when the player fails to bounce the ball back a life is lost. When the ball
  touches a block. it disappears. However, there are different blocks with
  varying properties, e.g. some may require multiple hits or can't be destroyed
  at all. In some occasions, a destroyed blocks drops a power up which has an
  effect on the gameplay when picked up with the paddle.
