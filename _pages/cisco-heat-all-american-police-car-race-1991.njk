description: In this racing game, the players get to race in police cars instead
  of the usual racing cars driven by speed freaks (like in the Crazy Cars
  series). Break the law instead of upholding it, while racing through the
  streets of San Francisco (Cisco for short, hence the name). Take in the Golden
  gate Bridge, China Town and the Twin Peaks. Avoid collisions with trams, other
  cars (driven by annoying citizens), buildings and road blockades etc., while
  trying to reach the next checkpoint before the time runs out!  Use your horn
  to alert other road-users of your presence.
