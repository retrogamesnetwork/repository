description: Of all the mundane tasks which've been turned into action-packed
  games, bug-repelling must be up there with being a Paper Boy or a Trashman.
  These aren't average bugs; Chicago is under siege from mutated insects, rats
  and even toy tanks. You'll have to work through seven houses, each of which
  has the typical rooms. You control a seemingly-dismembered hand, which must
  deal with the hordes as they come towards it, into the screen. They can be
  shot, thumped, or squashed depending on their type. To clear a room you must
  kill a certain number of creatures in each of the vertically-divided 'lanes'
  of the room - this causes squares on the ground to change colour.
