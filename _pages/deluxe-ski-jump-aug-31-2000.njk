description: Deluxe Ski Jump is a shareware ski jumping simulation with full 3D
  graphics and simulated physics. The game contains 32 different hills, which
  vary in size from the tiny K50 in England to the huge K250 in Slovenia. DSJ
  also allows for up to 16 players (computer or human controlled) to compete for
  the World Cup trophy simultaneously, using the same computer. The actual
  jumping is performed using the mouse buttons (for jumping and landing) and by
  moving the mouse up and down (to angle your jumper in flight), a system which
  takes practice to master. There are several factors that affect the outcome of
  a jump, of which the most important is timing. A poorly timed "take off" will
  most likely drag you down and force you to land prematurely. Other factors
  include wind strength and direction as well as a certain knowledge of the hill
  you're jumping from.
