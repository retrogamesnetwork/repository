description: The initial entry in the Front Page Sports lineup from
  Dynamix/Sierra, this was an ambitious simulation of North American football
  that tried to combine the arcade, coaching, and simulation football game
  experiences into a single package. Supported single game, season, and career
  modes with detailed statistics tracking, player aging and injuries, and the
  ability to save highlights of your best plays from any one of nine preset
  camera angles.  Featured a play editor in which you could make your own plays
  or edit any of the two hundred or so stock plays included with the game.
  Accommodated play styles ranging from joystick control of individual players
  to simulating a game entirely in a few seconds.
