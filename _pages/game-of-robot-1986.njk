description: Game of Robot is a text-mode action game in which the goal is to
  guide a character through a series of rooms, collect some gold, and bring it
  back to the starting location. The seven rooms along the way are partly
  designed with a fixed layout, partly generated randomly. Each room is
  initially populated by a number of robots (displayed as characters from the
  Greek alphabet) which try to reach the player in a direct line. If the player
  is touched by any of them, they lose a life. Robots can be eliminated either
  by leading them into electric fences (red hash characters), or moving isolator
  blocks in a way that traps them. The more pinned-down they are, the more
  likely they are to self-destruct. Only when all robots in a room are
  eliminated, the passage to the next room is opened. The randomly generated
  rooms have a chance of containing a teleport to a labyrinth room. Players have
  to observe the movement patterns of the robots in the labyrinth, in order to
  not get pinned into a corner by them as they move along the mostly linear
  hallways to the exit teleport. Leaving a labyrinth stage takes the player to
  the next stage, same as if they had normally completed the room from which
  they teleported into the labyrinth. Both the labyrinth stages and the final
  room contain gold bars, which the player is supposed to collect and bring back
  to room number 1. Dying leads to a loss of gold and one life. Pickups strewn
  around the stages include extra lives and clones, which help distract the
  robots. Once the gold has been returned to room number one, players can repeat
  the process to increase their score further, until they run out of lives. The
  original version of the game was developed for a custom-build home computer
  with an MOS Technology 6502 8-bit microprocessor. This DOS port was written in
  1986, and later served as the groundwork for the tile-graphics-based Game of
  Robot shareware game and its successors.
