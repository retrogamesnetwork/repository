description: "Things have not gone well since the last Alien War. The world
  resources have been exhausted, and most of the population have been
  concentrated into the last hope: Mega-Primus, a self-sufficient city. Things
  are starting look good until a strange portal opened in the sky, and UFOs
  emerged from it. It seems that the X-COM is needed again. X-COM: Apocalypse is
  a sequel to X-COM: Terror from the Deep, and is the third entry in the X-COM
  series. It is a real-time / turn-based strategy game that features a mix of
  research, resource management, macro tactical combat, and micro tactical
  combat. At the city screen, the player controls vehicles to engage the threats
  (everything from rival factions to alien UFOs). If a UFO has landed or
  infiltration has been reported, the vehicles will land/dock at the infestation
  site and engage in tactical combat with the equipment at hand. Once the player
  managed to capture aliens and alien equipment, the scientists can research and
  perhaps even copy them for the player's use. The player will also need to
  balance the budget as everything costs money, from agents to equipment. The
  various human factions must be kept happy, otherwise they might turn against
  the X-COM. The player must hire recruits, buy weapons, ammo, and equipment to
  outfit his squads in the vehicles (including weapons on the vehicles and their
  ammo). The management mode for tracking down UFOs is called the Cityscape;
  combat takes place in a separate environment, the Battlescape, where the
  player engages the individual aliens that managed to escape. Differences from
  the previous games in the series include reworked graphics, larger maps, a
  more complex world, and the possibility of choosing between real-time or
  turn-based tactical combat. Also, instead of just engaging aliens, the player
  will also have to deal with multiple human factions, from a cult that worships
  alien invaders to gangs, from industrial giants to security forces."
