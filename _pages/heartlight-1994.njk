description: A game that's very similar to Boulder Dash - the basic idea of
  collecting things while avoiding being crushed is the same. The protagonist of
  the game is a dwarf named Mosiek, who decided to marry Rachel. A necessary
  condition, however, is showing the cunning and skill. He goes to a magical
  world in order to collect all the hearts. Assisting in completing the task are
  bombs and balloons, disturb stones and walls. In each level player must
  collect all the hearts, in order to open a door-portal to the next stage. The
  game features 64 levels.
