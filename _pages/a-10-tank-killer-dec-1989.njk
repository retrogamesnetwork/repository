description: This simulation puts you in the cockpit of the A-10 Thunderbolt II,
  which is also known as the "Warthog". As the game's name implies, it is used
  mainly to hunt enemy tanks, but also for destroying roads and bridges You are
  armed with 30mm Avenger cannon which can fire around 70 times a second.
  Multiple camera angles are featured. Landing is automated and an accelerated
  time function is on offer. Characters have full AI to act without your
  involvement, and will communicate with you in-flight. Actions in one mission
  affect another - something you failed to destroy in one mission can attack you
  later. Version 1.5 re-released in 1991 added 7 new scenarios set during the
  Operation Desert Storm in Iraq.
