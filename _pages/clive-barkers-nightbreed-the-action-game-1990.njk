description: "This is the first of a planned trilogy of games based on Clive
  Barker's movie Nightbreed (the second game was Nightbreed: The Interactive
  Movie, and the third game was never released).  This is a side-scrolling
  action game where Boone must fight his way through Midian, fighting the Sons
  of the Free and the Berserkers. There are five legs to Boone's quest as listed
  in the manual: 1)  Collect the 3 keys to Midian; one is located on each
  level.  In order to obtain the 3rd key, you must defeat the MASK (although he
  will subsequently escape). 2)  Work your way around the Necropolis and down
  through Midian to the Nightbreeds' God, BAPHOMET, who will then baptize
  you.  This will enable you to transform into CABAL for short periods of
  time.  CABAL can withstand attack better than BOONE and has greater strength
  than his alter ego. 3)  Open the door to the BERSERKERS chamber. 4)  Work your
  way up to the surface of Midian to free the Breed.  They then tell you that
  the MASK has your girlfriend, LORI. 5)  Descend back down and engage in the
  ultimate battle with the MASK.  With victory achieved, you must get back to
  the surface of Midian where you will be re-united with LORI."
