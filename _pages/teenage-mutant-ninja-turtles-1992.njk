description: "April O'Neil, the reporter friend of the Teenage Mutant Ninja
  Turtles, is kidnapped by the villainous Shredder and his two goons, Bebop and
  Rocksteady. The four ninja turtles: Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello and
  Leonardo fight their way through hordes of Foot Soldiers in order to rescue
  April. They battle familiar foes such as the mad scientist Baxter Stockman,
  General Traag from Dimension X and the evil alien brain Krang, up to the final
  showdown with Shredder himself. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an arcade game
  made by Konami during the height of the cartoon series' popularity. Depending
  on the version of the game, up to two, three or four players can take part in
  the action. The game plays like a simplified Double Dragon. While most of the
  standard Foot Soldier enemies are easily dispatched, some attack with knives
  or ray guns and are thus more dangerous. At the end of each level, players
  encounter a boss (or in certain cases two bosses working in tandem, such as
  Bebop and Rocksteady). The NES version of the game, renamed Teenage Mutant
  Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game in the West, features additional content not
  present in other versions of the game: two new levels (Snowy Central Park and
  The Dojo), new bosses (including Tora, Shogun and Baxter Stockman as a fly),
  additional music tracks as well as more variations of Foot Soldiers."
