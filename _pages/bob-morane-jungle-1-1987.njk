description: "Bob Morane, hero of the Francophone series of adventure novels and
  comic books, parachutes into the South American jungle near the ruins of an
  Inca sanctuary at the foot of the Andes.  Guide Bob through the hostile
  rainforest and labyrinthine ruins, help him stop his mortal enemy - the Yellow
  Shadow - from laying his dirty hands on the ancient treasure buried within,
  and free his friend Bill Ballantine who's being held prisoner on the premises.
  Much like Iznogoud, Sidewalk and Bob Morane: Chevalerie 1, the action is
  confined to a small viewport and your hero can traverse the static screens in
  two dimensions, right to left or front to back.  You'll have to overcome
  gigantic jungle beasts, enemy agents, and strange mechanical devices that
  resemble nothing in particular; fortunately, you can keep track of their
  locations using your \"magneto-thermal detector\", and fend them off with your
  trusty knife or with a bundle of dynamite (also useful for clearing away
  stubborn walls and blockages)."
