  This time there are 8 events which can be played, which are: Figure Skating,
  Cross Country Skiing, Speed Skating, Ski Jumping, Slalom, Downhill Skiing and
  Luge. Up to 8 players can either play the complete Olympics, compete in one or
  more events or simply practice an event. Some events can be played
  simultaneously (Cross Country Skiing, Slalom and Speed Skating) while the
  others have to be played one after another."
