description: "This multiple-choice quiz game, published as part of Big Blue Disk
  #21, asks one hundred questions about computer hardware and
  software.  Interestingly, the player is given three \"men,\" and loses a man
  every time a question is answered incorrectly.  Bonus men can be earned by
  answering ten questions correctly.  At the end of play, men are cashed in for
  points, meaning that the best possible score is 113.  Obviously, this is a bit
  dated, but it's a fun snapshot of the computer world of the late eighties."
