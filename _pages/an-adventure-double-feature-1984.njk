  choose your own adventure graphical text adventure. In Adventures in the
  Microzone, the player is somehow shrunk to 2 inches in size when they use
  their computer in the early morning.  The player must explore either their own
  or their grandfather's room in search of the computer manual to return
  themselves to size.  Along the way, they player might have to explore a maze
  of straws, avoid the dangers of caffeine, and try not to get lost in their
  messy closet. In Northwoods Adventure, the player is off camping with their
  family, when they wake up early and decide to go exploring.  The player can
  either go for a hike in the woods or go on a canoe trip down down the
  river.  Text descriptions show the journey, and the player is presented with
  options to travel in different directions, and how to explore the woods.  The
  player can bring with them a walking stick, binoculars, or a compass and
  map.  Players can end up lost in a swamp, twisting their ankle and getting
  rescued, breaking their canoe on some rapids, and many other outcomes."
