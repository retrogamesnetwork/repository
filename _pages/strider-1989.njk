description: The year is 2048 AD. In Russia, the evil Grand Master Meio has
  begun his insane plot to take over the universe. A lone figure drops from a
  stealth glider into Meio's base. He is Hiryu, Super A-Class Strider. His
  mission is to defeat the Grand Master and put an end to his plotting once and
  for all. Strider lets the protagonist run, jump, perform acrobatics and climb
  walls and overhangs. He wields a plasma sword, called a Cypher, through five
  levels fighting robots and guards, with mid- and end-level bosses.
