description: Wall Pipe is a real-time puzzle game where you need to lead flowing
  water through a series of pipes. On each screen is a water source, and a
  number of pipe parts queued up for you to build the pipeline with, by picking
  the first pipe-part in the queue, using your mouse, and placing it where you
  want. Some planning ahead is possible, as the next three queued parts are
  visible. There is a 40 second delay after the level starts until the water
  flows, during which time you can try to build the longest pipe from the
  available parts. It is not possible to turn the parts around to fit the
  connection, unlike e.g. Tetris, nor can you see the part you have in your
  hand, so you must remember the shape, once it's removed from the queue. Once
  the water starts flowing it's a race against time, as the water flows faster
  than you can place the pipes. When the water cannot flow through the pipes, or
  you run out of connectable pipes, the game ends. Sometimes the screen has a
  dedicated outlet to which you need to connect your pipes in order to win. You
  get points for the amount of parts used, and for 'loops' in the pipeline,
  which are possible through interconnection pipes. You lose points for placing
  pipe parts that don't hold any water at the end of the round, except in a
  bonus round. If you manage to get enough (or any) points, there is a
  high-score list where you can inscribe your initials for posterity.
