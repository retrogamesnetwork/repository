description: The game uses the name of genuine cricketer and adheres to the
  one-day cricket 1991 rules interpreted by developers for the guidance.
  Contested by two teams of eleven players each, cricket is a very technical
  bat-and-ball game played on a grass oval-shaped field, in the centre of which
  are a flat strip of ground, called a cricket pitch, and two wooden wickets
  placed at each end of the pitch. The bowler, a player from the fielding team,
  bowls a hard, fist-sized cricket ball from the vicinity of one wicket towards
  the other. The ball usually bounces once before reaching the batsman, a player
  from the opposing team. In defence of the wicket, the batsman plays the ball
  with a wooden cricket bat. Meanwhile, the other members of the bowler's team
  stand in various positions around the field as fielders, players who retrieve
  the ball in an effort to stop the batsman scoring runs, and if possible to get
  him or her out. The batsman ‚Äî if he or she does not get out ‚Äî may run between
  the wickets, exchanging ends with a second batsman (the "non-striker"), who
  has been waiting near the bowler's wicket. Each completed exchange of ends
  scores one run. Runs are also scored if the batsman hits the ball to the
  boundary of the playing area. The match is won by the team that scores more
  runs. Choosing between a bowler, or a batsman, game player defines the role of
  its team. During the match game player may control all his team players,
  nearest to the ball to achieve the main goal. Power, direction, and the moment
  should be used properly to achieve it more successfully. Eight countries
  (England, New Zealand, Australia, Sri Lanka, South Africa, India, West Indies,
  and Pakistan) are available to select and game player/players may be appointed
  either to CPU, which has a three difficulty levels, or to human.
