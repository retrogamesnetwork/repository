description: "Microsoft Windows 3.0 is a multi-tasking operating system by
  Microsoft. Included with Windows 3.0 are two game: Reversi and Solitaire.
  Reversi is a no-nonsense adaptation of the popular board game Othello. The
  player plays against the AI. There are multiple skill levels at which the game
  can be played. Player and AI take turn placing one of their tokens (red and
  blue) on the field. The token may only be placed adjacent to an existing
  token. If a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row of any number of same-color
  token is closed in by the other color, the row changes color. The player with
  most coverage when the board is filled wins the game. The game uses vector
  graphics that scale along with the size of the window it is played in. The
  game is identical as seen in all earlier releases of Windows Windows 3.0 is
  the first edition of Windows to feature Solitaire. In this card game, the goal
  is to put all the cards sorted (ace, two, ..., queen, king) by color into the
  four fields at the top. When starting a game, the target fields are empty, the
  main field consists of 7 piles or cards, whereby only the top one is visible,
  also in an ascending amount (left side one card, right side 7 cards), and the
  rest of the cards are in one pile at top left. Cards can only be moved from
  one pile to another when putting a lower card of the opposite color on a
  higher card, when the pile is empty, kings can be placed there, and finally,
  when the target piles are empty, only aces can be put there (then twos on
  aces, etc.). When all cards are sorted in the target piles, the player has won
  the game. If no more allowed moves are possible, the player has lost the
  game."
