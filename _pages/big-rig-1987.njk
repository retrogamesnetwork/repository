description: Big Rig is a simulation that lets you experience the life of a
  long-distance trucker. Your task is to safely drive a 18-wheel tractor-trailer
  combination from coast to coast in time, trying to make a profitable trip. The
  gameplay and user interface are pretty basic. The game is played in text mode
  only, with your choice made by typing the right letter at the prompt. At the
  beginning of your trip, you can choose between three types of cargo (with or
  without time limit, perishable or not) and three routes -- each with different
  characteristics, like length or chances for bad weather etc. After these
  preliminaries, you begin your trip. Gameplay is turnwise. At each turn, you
  choose your travelling speed (go too fast, and you may be stopped by the
  police -- too slow and you may not arrive in time). You‚Äôll have to keep an eye
  on your fitness and your gasometer ‚Äì driving tired can result in deadly
  accidents, and running out of gas will cost you time and money. Gas and sleep
  can be replenished at truck stops. You‚Äôll also be slowed down by roadworks,
  flat tires, accidents, traffic jams, bad weather -- all those little things
  that make trucking fun! To get to New York in time, you‚Äôll need strategical
  planning, and a small amount of luck, too. And you'll get to learn a bit about
  the daily chores of your average trucker.
