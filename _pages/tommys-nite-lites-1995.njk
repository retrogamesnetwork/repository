description: Tommy's Nite Lites! is a single player DOS Puzzle game released as
  shareware. The game takes place on a grid measuring six squares by six. A
  number of the squares in the grid are shaded. The object of the game is to
  clear all the squares on the grid in the fewest possible moves. The player
  does this by selecting cells within the grid. This causes the cell, and all
  cells diagonally adjacent to it to change from shaded to unshaded or vice
  versa. The player starts with 10,000 points and loses a point for every move
  made. The game can be saved and restarted. The full game has nine levels of
  difficulty, the shareware release contains levels 1 & 2 only.
