description: Emeritus Pong is a clone of the Pong game. It allows to compete
  with another player or against the computer. It features a single game mode as
  well, where the player may practice bouncing from the wall. There is a demo
  clock mode included, showing the current time. The gameplay itself remains
  unchanged. Players control a paddle represented by a white line. One paddle is
  on the right side of the screen, the other on the left. The current score is
  shown at the top.
