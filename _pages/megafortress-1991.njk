description: Megafortress is a flight simulation based on the premise of Dale
  Brown 's Flight of the Old Dog novel. The player is in command of a crew
  flying a super modified and experimental B-52 bomber, outfitted with the
  latest weapons and stealth technology. (In the novel, it was more advanced
  than the B-1 Excalibur, the Strategic Air Command's most advanced bomber). The
  game campaign mostly takes place in Iraq, but there is 1 mission that takes
  the bomber to the old Soviet Union like in the novel.
