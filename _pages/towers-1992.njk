description: Towers is a timed puzzle game, where the object is to build as high
  a tower as possible, by filling out levels with bricks. There is limited time
  to build each level of the tower, and what you manage to build will be the
  base for the next level. There are a few different shaped bases to begin with,
  rectangular, diamond, of hollow bases. The bricks come in odd shapes, like
  Tetris -shaped blocks lying down, and they are queued up so you have to place
  one before seeing the next shape. If a brick won't fit, you can discard it
  with a time penalty, and hopefully get a better brick-shape next. Ideally you
  should fill the entire floor to make a flat base for the next level. When the
  time runs out for the level, it is 'trimmed' and scored, and the next level
  begins, until the area is too small to continue. Each new level has increasing
  demands on time, and the minimum sized group of bricks required to continue
  upwards. After the game ends, either by you selecting to quit, or by the
  'minimum group' demands exceeding the available floorspace, the tower is
  scored, you can end up in the hall of fame, if you managed to build higher
  than previous players. You can also admire the tower you built from eight
  different directions and from different distances, but this is not saved for
  posterity.
