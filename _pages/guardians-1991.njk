description: Guardians is a puzzle game in which the player takes the role of a
  guardian who is tasked with containing the so-called "Triffids", balls of pure
  energy. The game is played in a top-down perspective and has two plains. The
  upper plane is where the player is active and has to build walls. There are
  blocks of five colours which can be freely moved over the area. If multiple
  blocks of the same colour come together, they fuse together and are no longer
  mobile; those fusions are called "cohesions".  Some blocks can be combined
  with any colour. The player can both use blocks which are already on the plain
  and place bricks from a reservoir. One to three triffids are on the lower
  plain and bounce up and down. If they bounce up and there is block hindering
  them, they are lost and give minus points. Regular blocks are destroyed when
  they come into contact; only cohesions are a permanent wall. The goal of each
  level is get a certain amount of points (by creating cohesions) within a time
  limit.
