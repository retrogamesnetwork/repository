description: In the two volumes of Elfland you play as an Elf fighting off the
  evil trolls that have invaded your homeland.  In volume one make the perilous
  journey to Gorgimer's Castle to get a potion that will help against the
  trolls. Gorgimer the Alchemist isn't friendly to strangers so you must find a
  way to convince him to help the Elves.  In volume two you will continue the
  adventure as you rescue the village elves by defeating the Troll Chieftain. At
  the start of the game, choose to play as a boy or girl (Elfie or
  Elfita).  Gameplay consists largely of platform jumping while avoiding
  enemies.  You can jump up into trees, across clouds, and down into darkened
  caverns.  An assortment of enemies will attack and block your way, but it is
  possible to temporarily stun them by throwing flash berries. The game is over
  when your life meter reaches zero. The adventuring aspect of this game
  consists of talking to other characters that reveal tips and plot
  developments. Every friendly NPC has something to say.  The game starts in the
  safety of the Elf village, so talk to everyone.  While exploring Elfland
  you'll find flash berries, gems, cherries, and other bonus items.  In this
  game elves can't swim, so be careful around water, usually a turtle will help
  out.  Plenty of secret things are waiting to be found so look up in the
  clouds. Finally, the game features a handy save and reload system.  The game
  is divided into two major chapters, the first of which can be freely
  downloaded. Elfland was inspired by Captain Comic and ID's Commander Keen
  series.
