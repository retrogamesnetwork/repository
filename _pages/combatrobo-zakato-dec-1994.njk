description: Combatrobo Zakato is a Korean-made sci-fi side-scrolling shooter in
  which the player controls a giant mecha sent into a hostile area in deep space
  to fight mechanized aliens. Though the mecha can move freely in eight
  directions, the game doesn't play exactly like a scrolling shoot-em-up,
  because the screen scrolls horizontally or vertically only if the player
  character moves in the correspondent direction. The player can choose various
  weapons and limited ammunition types for each mission; however, all weapons
  can only shoot forward. The player can turn the mecha around by pressing a
  separate button. Stages usually end with boss battles.
