description: A one-on-one, real time strategy war game.  Conquer the world or
  fight smaller battles.  Choose your time period/scenario (1918, 1942, 1986,
  2023, or ????); the later the date the more advanced the game.  The 1918 games
  provide only land and sea units.  1942 adds air units and carriers.  1986 and
  beyond add nukes, satellites, oil considerations, and foreign aid. You can
  create custom layouts (scenarios).  Games can also be saved to "film" so you
  can watch them again.  You can even watch the game up to a certain point and
  then start playing it. As for opponents, you can play five different levels of
  computer opponent or a friend on another computer.  Two person play requires a
  modem or serial link.
