description: "You might be mistaken for thinking that the \"treasure hunt in a
  mansion full of secrets\" theme had been played out -- if not in text
  adventures, then surely in interactive CD-ROMs.  And yet here is a text
  adventure that puts us squarely in that familiar setting, but one which
  siphons out the worn cliches and tired pretension and shores up the fragile
  framework with a vigorous injection of healthy, red-blooded absurd fun. One
  magical Christmas you visit your grandfather's estate at Attervist Manor, only
  to discover him mysteriously caught in an unwakeable slumber, suspiciously
  bearing a letter from the solicitors of the sinister dentist who lives next
  door regarding his purchase of Grandad's estate.  You will travel the length
  and breadth of this estate in search of a cure to your grandfather's condition
  and buried treasure to ensure the estate's financial independence. But that's
  not what this game is about: it's about the particle accelerator in the
  bedroom and the Viking longboat stuck in the pond ice; it's about the
  clockwork shark (Grandad's contribution to the war effort) baking goodies in
  the kitchen; it's about needing the gloves so you can pick up the
  hedgehog.  No, these don't make sense -- but as games are about fun we can
  overlook that and hide it beneath the Groucho Marx-glasses of \"whimsy.\""
