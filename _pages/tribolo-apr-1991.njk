description: Tribolo is a single-player game based on the traditional board game
  Othello. Where this game differs from most other Othello based games is that
  there are two computer opponents, the player is always blue while the computer
  plays as red and green. The game starts with twelve tiles of each colour
  scattered around the game area together with twelve grey tiles which are
  'no-go- cells. This gives the game its other major difference in that the
  board is not fixed, the position of these grey cells varies from game to game.
