description: Fleuch is a single player game from Germany, it is a port of a game
  the author had previously released on the Amiga. The game is keyboard
  controlled and plays a little like a Lunar Lander variant but instead of
  landing the player must manoeuvre a space craft near a ball, pick it up, and
  then take to the skies to complete the level. Sounds simple enough but to make
  things a bit more interesting there are gun turrets firing at the player's
  ship. In the shareware version of the game there are just three levels, when
  the player completes the last level they start again at level one on a harder
  difficulty setting. This process repeats until all three of the player's lives
  have been lost. The full game has ten levels The game has a number of features
  including an optional in-game mini-map feature, the ability to save in-game
  screenshots (in .tga format), and optional sound.
