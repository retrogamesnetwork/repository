description: "We're Back!: A Dinosaur's Story is different from its Genesis
  counterpart.  This version features characters from the movie, but does not
  follow the storyline of the movie. In this version, Professor Screw Eyes has
  kidnapped Louie and Cecilia. Hearing of this, Captain Neweyes and the
  dinosaurs launch into action to save their friends by traveling through
  various time periods. The gameplay is a side-scroller that has the player take
  control of Rex, traveling throughout the levels avoiding traps and defeating
  various enemies scattered throughout the stages (five in all). Rex can also
  receive help from his dinosaur pals, Elsa, Woog, Vorb, and Dweeb from time to
  time. There are also power-ups that increase and replenish Rex's health."
