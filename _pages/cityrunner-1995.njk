description: CityRunner is a futuristic search-and-rescue driving game featuring
  a 3D voxel-based environment, all in 4KB (!) of executable size.  The player
  sits behind the wheel of a polygonal police car (shuttle? hovercraft?) and
  gets to zoom along the city streets in search of trouble hotspots, indicated
  by flashing buildings, which must be located and bumped against to rescue the
  distressed citizens therein.  The objective is to save as many targets as
  quickly as possible, without running out of time or crashing the vehicle in
  the process. Each assignment starts at the station, with a time limit, a set
  number of targets, and full shields to protect the car against impact.  The
  cutting-edge vehicle can drive forwards and backwards with equal ease, and is
  equipped with a speed-boost pedal for those long straight streets.  Points are
  awarded for saving buildings and completing missions - swift action is
  rewarded with higher scores.  Once all buildings have been saved, it's back to
  the police station to recharge the shields and get a new assignment (with more
  targets). Unsafe driving may result in nasty collisions with buildings, which
  take a toll on the shields; wreck the car completely (or run out of time) and
  it's game over.  For navigational aid, an interactive map screen can be called
  up at any time and scrolled / zoomed / rotated at will.
