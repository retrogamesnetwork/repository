description: Tubular Worlds was a fairly popular shareware side-scrolling
  shooter which was commercially released in 1994. The game features a variety
  of weapons and enemies. It is divided into four worlds and each of them
  consists of four stages. Gameplay is rather basic and there are many
  similarities to "R-Type". The game can be played by one or two simultaneous
  players on three different difficulty levels.
