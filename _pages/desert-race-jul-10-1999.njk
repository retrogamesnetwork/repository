description: Desert Race holds the possible distinction of being the first (and
  only?) animated driving game programmed entirely as a DOS batch file.  This
  implies all the expected limitations - system commands only, no real
  graphics/hardware access, and the absence of most useful programming
  constructs.  Nevertheless, it manages to implement a top-down car race in
  ASCII graphics, albeit without real-time continuous play (the game waits for a
  keypress before advancing to the next frame). There's even a story, in which
  you set forth on a brutal race for survival in a post-apocalyptic Mad
  Max-style scenario.  The game takes place at night, and so only a section of
  the road is visible, fading to black at the edges; your only controls are
  moving left and right to switch lanes, trying to avoid incoming cars as they
  emerge from the darkness.  Colliding with a car (or with the edge of the road)
  will permanently extinguish your road rage.
