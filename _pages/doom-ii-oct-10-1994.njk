description: In this sequel to the original DOOM, the protagonist is still the
  same hero - the last remaining space marine. After having single-handedly
  saved Mars from demonic threat, he returns to Earth, only to find out that the
  demons have already invaded it, killed most of its inhabitants or possessed
  them. It's his task to bring down the force field around the last operational
  star port to allow the remnants of mankind to escape to the stars. DOOM II
  looks and plays very similarly to its predecessor, utilizing the same 3D
  graphical engine with 2D sprites for enemies. The gameplay once again consists
  entirely of navigating the hero from first-person view through 3D environments
  and shooting at the demons while attempting to find the way out by flipping
  switches and looking for keys. Unlike in DOOM, which is divided into three
  episodes, the 30 levels of this game (plus the 2 secret levels) form one long
  episode. The game adds one new weapon to the player's arsenal; the super
  shotgun, several new demon types with more advanced attacks than those of the
  predecessor, such as the chaingun-toting Heavy Weapon Dudes, the skeletal
  Revenants who launch homing missiles and the sinister Arch-Viles who have a
  highly damaging fire attack.
