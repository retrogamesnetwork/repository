description: Wibarm is an action game with RPG elements, and several gameplay
  modes. The player controls a robot who can also transform into a tank or a
  flying spacecraft; each form has its own strengths and weaknesses. Similarly
  to Thexder, the player guides the transformable robot through side-scrolling
  levels, shooting at enemies and trying to stay alive. However, when the robot
  enters a building, the game transforms into one of the earlier examples of a
  3D, third-person perspective shooter. The levels culminate in boss battles,
  which take place on separate top-down areas. The player is given a
  considerable freedom as to which locations to visit first. Collecting power
  units increases the robot's power. If a particular boss encounter proves to be
  too difficult, the player can explore other areas, level up, and return to the
  boss stronger than before, giving the game an RPG angle.
