description: "Bong Bong is a simple arcade platformer, featuring a little bunny
  rabbit with an unquenchable passion for sugary foodstuffs.  Climb ladders,
  jump over traps and hop across platforms to grab every food item in sight: get
  them all, and the next level will present an entirely new type of delicacy to
  quell your appetite.  Beware the scorpions, and watch out for mystery jars -
  most of them will get you a score bonus, but some may contain a snake."
