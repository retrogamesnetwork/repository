description: "Taking a tip from 1977's Surround for the 2600 (and later, the
  1982 movie Tron and its light-bike spin-offs -- but don't ask me where the
  banana came in!) this is one of those games where you control an extending
  line on the screen, avoiding collision with your own trail or that of the
  other player(s). No exciting changes are made to the time-tested formula: the
  conventional options include game speed, number of players (2-3) and whether
  the game screen has confining borders or wraps around."
