description: "The protagonist in Galactix is a bipedal alien of the green,
  stalk-eyed variety.  This being has just crash-landed on a planet and, to his
  considerable dismay, discovered that his spaceship won't power on again.  Your
  task is to guide the distraught xenomorph past the dangers of this
  inhospitable world, locate the five items required to repair the ship, and
  hopefully make it back out of this hellhole (in one piece). Your makeshift
  prison is a flip-screen maze of interconnected rooms, inhabited by hostile
  locals who stand ready to dissuade you from your quest in person - being shot
  (or even touched) by them will deplete your life energy, and they respawn even
  after death when a room is re-entered.  Although Galactix is basically a
  platform action game, the controls are somewhat atypical: walking, shooting
  and jumping have their own keys, but inventory-related actions must be
  selected from a menu, as in an adventure game.  These include picking up,
  dropping, examining, using, and eating/drinking items; the player can carry up
  to five objects at a time.  Appropriately, a scrolling message area gives
  descriptive verbal reports of your actions and their results.  As a visual
  clue for your overall progress, your score is displayed as a percentage on a
  bar."
