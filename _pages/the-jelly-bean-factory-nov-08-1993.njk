description: The Jelly Bean Factory is a single-player, shareware falling block
  game. Coloured blocks, or jelly beans fall from the top of the screen. Each
  bean has three coloured balls in it and the player must position them so that
  when they hit the bottom of the screen they make rows of three or more of the
  same colour. The colour sequence of each bean can be altered as it falls,
  there are reject beans that are hard to remove and there are clearing beans
  that remove all beans that match the first colour they make contact with. The
  game is controlled either by the keyboard or by a keyboard/joystick
  combination. It has optional sound, a high score table, four levels of
  difficulty, nine levels, and other customizable options.
