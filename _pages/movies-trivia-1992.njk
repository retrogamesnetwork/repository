description: Movies Trivia is a shareware, or "try before you buy", quiz game
  for up to four players. This is a 'Trivia Shell' game meaning that the basic
  software can be applied to many different subjects by changing the load screen
  and question packs. The game has three levels of difficulty which it applies
  to the same question pack. For example given the question "In what comedy
  western was the song "Buttons and Bows" first heard?" on the Beginner setting
  the player would be given the answer and True/False buttons; on the
  Intermediate setting the player would be given four choices; and on the
  Advanced setting the player would have to type in the complete answer. With
  multiplayer games it is possible to have players on different difficulty
  settings - useful when parents are playing against children for example. The
  game has a hint feature and a high score table that shows the top five scores
  for each difficulty setting. If the player answers five correct questions in a
  row they are rewarded with a bonus question. Games can be configured to be any
  length, the default is thirty questions, and can be restricted to particular
  film genres. There is an optional hint feature. The shareware game has just
  105 questions while the registered games have either three hundred or six
  hundred questions.
