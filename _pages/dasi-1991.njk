description: Nothing less than a computerized spirit board (of which the Ouija
  is the best known), DaSi lets you commune with whatever technologically-savvy
  spirits may be channeling through the astral plane near you using an ordinary
  computer mouse as the planchette, spelling out messages letter by letter. It
  just lays down the infrastructure -- you've got to bring the spooks yourself.
