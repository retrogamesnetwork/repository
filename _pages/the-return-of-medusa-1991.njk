description: "In Rings of Medusa Prince Cirion managed to defeat Medusa who
  threatened to overthrow his kingdom Morenor. Unfortunately she has a new plan:
  travelling to the future (2200) when Cirion is long dead. Of course he pursues
  her and now his quest of defeating Medusa begins anew. This time the main goal
  is finding thirteen keys which are divided over dungeons all over the country.
  The change of scenario, the predecessor was set in medieval times, means that
  there is modern weaponry and technology. In order to find the keys, the player
  needs to build up an army and gather enough money to search for them and
  defeat Medusa's city. There are several ways to do this, the most important
  being trade. Other options are searching for treasure on the world map or
  playing roulette at a casino. Important for success is the assembly of the
  army as there are multiple races, classes and weaponry to choose from. The
  main addition in comparison to the predecessor are the dungeons which are
  shown from a first person-view. The player can take up to three companions
  into those dungeons and needs to solve puzzles and defeat enemies in real-time
  (ranged with firearms) in order to reach the goal. The game is also in
  real-time when travelling on the world map; only inside the cities where the
  management part takes place the time is stopped. There is also the occasional
  arcade sequence to solve."
