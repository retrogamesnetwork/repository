description: "The Freaks are invading!  These colorful blob-like aliens may look
  harmless enough, but like Tribbles with eyeballs, they're popping up
  everywhere - and multiplying fast.  After much deliberation, the soon-to-be
  conquered people of Earth devise a cunning method to quell the alien surge:
  challenge the freakish little globs to a game of elimination... with the
  Freaks as pieces. Freak Out is a fast-paced strategy game where each level
  takes the player to a different location, to contain the attack of the fuzzy
  intruders.  The playing field consists of interconnected cells, arranged in
  concentric squares.  The Freaks (which come in four different colors) pop out
  of a hatch at the center, and can be moved about by rotating and smacking
  them, which sends them jumping to the next cell (if it isn't occupied).  To
  score points and eliminate Freaks, three of the same color must be placed in
  adjacent cells, making them vanish in a puff of smoke. Speed is essential,
  since the quickly-reproducing aliens line up behind the hatch: if you let the
  queue get too long, it's game over.  Random items and obstacles pop up
  occasionally, like bonus gems, freezing ice, stone walls, or colored circles
  (which can only be occupied by a Freak of the same hue).  As the game
  advances, new challenges and mini-puzzles appear, which force the player to
  respond before more Freaks can be eliminated.  A password records the player's
  progress after every level."
