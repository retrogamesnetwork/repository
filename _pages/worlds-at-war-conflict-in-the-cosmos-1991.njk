description: "Worlds at War: Conflict in the Cosmos is a 4x science fiction
  space navy combat simulation game along the lines of Reach for the Stars: The
  Conquest of the Galaxy. The player controls a fleet of space ships and bases,
  and proceeds to build ships, locate enemy bases, and take over the galaxy - or
  go down in defeat. The game has an abstract board game style feel, but at
  higher difficulties adjacent regions can become more difficult to reach or
  even disconnected. Gameplay is always similar and in two dimensions, but the
  game setting can be selected as space or planetary seas for different
  difficulty levels and environment behavior."
