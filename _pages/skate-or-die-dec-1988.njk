description: Skate or Die incorporates five distinct styles of skating, which
  can be attempted individually or in turn. You skate around a menu room to
  choose which one to attempt. Before taking off you can visit Rodney's skate
  shop to buy equipment. The first event is freestyle, in which your aim is to
  score as many points as possible in 10 attempts. Judges determine how much
  style and skill you have shown. The High Jump uses the same equipment, only
  this time your task is to jump as high as possible at the end of the ramp. The
  downhill events are overhead-view races. In the Downhill Race you simply try
  to complete the course within 90 seconds. In the Downhill Jam you try to
  outperform a human or computer opponent whilst dodging or jumping hazards. You
  can use attacking moves to either remove hazards or knock your opponent over.
  The pool joust is more of a one-on-one beat em up using a stick, set within a
  pit to skate around.
