description: Saper is a two-dimensional platform game with elements of
  puzzle-solving. The story tells of a criminal organization, which managed to
  steal important NATO documents. CIA agents have failed to recover the
  documents, therefore the authorities decide to blow up the headquarters of
  criminals. The building has many explosives installed. The player has to
  destroy all the bombs which are visible on the screen and then reach an exit
  point. Some of the bombs and exits are not easily reachable. To get access to
  them it is necessary to move some tiles too. The basis for the completion of
  the mission is the order of detonation explosive devices. There are tiles
  which have unique purposes. An additional difficulty is the time limit, to
  pass each of the 64 levels of the game authors dedicate 120 seconds. The
  player will face as well disappearing tiles, exploding mines or surfaces of
  ice that move the player to the first no ice area. In contrast, the expanding
  plant, the detonator of all bombs or the teleport should greatly facilitate
  the task. The game has a built-in editor which allows to modify all the
  completed boards.
