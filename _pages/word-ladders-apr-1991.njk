description: Word Ladders is a variant on the common word puzzle in which the
  player must turn one word into another by changing one letter at a time, with
  each intervening step still being a valid English word.  The game is broken
  into rounds which offer increasingly challenging puzzles; there is an optional
  Expert Mode which adds further difficulty to play.  Each puzzle has a par,
  which is the number of steps the player is expected to need to complete a
  transformation.  Breaking par causes a penalty to the score, while completing
  a puzzle quickly leads to a timer-related bonus.  Players start the game with
  three lives, and lives are lost by running out of time or (in Expert Mode
  only) attempting to create an invalid word.
