description: "My Own Stories is an adaptation of Storybook Weaver - the
  educational game/application that allows children of 8 to 14 years of age  to
  write their own stories. Now those stories are based not on fairy tales, but
  on everyday contemporary situations. The objects present as possible
  illustrations for stories depict real life experiences: city, town, school,
  gym, sports, beach, backyard etc. Change sizes and colors of the objects put
  on pages is also possible, as well as adding music and sound effects and
  printing all the results."
