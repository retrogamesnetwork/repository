description: This program helps its user to learn American Sign Language.  Using
  vector graphics, it allows the player to look up the signs for various letters
  and words; it can even read a text file on screen in ASL at variable
  speeds.  Once the user has studied sufficiently, the program offers a quiz
  mode where it displays signs and requires the user to type in what they
  mean.  The program is quite configurable, even allowing the user to specify
  whether the signs displayed on screen should be right- or left-handed.
