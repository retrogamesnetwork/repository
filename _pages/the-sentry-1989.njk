description: A surreal and very original game by Geoff Crammond. The game plays
  out on a 3D landscape with hills and valleys made up of several levels. At the
  highest vantage point stands The Sentinel,  a statue-like being with an energy
  draining stare,  you begin at the lowest.  "Energy" plays an important
  role,  there's a constant amount in the game world and each object is worth a
  certain number of units - including you. The object of each level is to absorb
  The Sentinel and Hyperspace to the next from his vantage point. The Sentinel
  scans further round the landscape every few seconds - if you're caught in his
  gaze,  or rather the square you are standing on can be seen,  you'll have
  about 5 seconds to teleport to another location (or hit a key to teleport to a
  random location - which will never be higher,  and may be lower than your
  current level) before the Sentinel begins absorbing your energy,  when it
  reaches zero you will be destroyed. To travel a "robot hull" must be created
  on a visible square then teleported to,  making sure you absorb your old hull
  to avoid losing energy. Boulders and trees can also be created,  trees to
  block The Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain higher ground.
  There are a few other elements to the game - on later levels there will be
  other Sentries positioned around the landscape. If only part of you can be
  seen i.e. not the square you are standing on, a nearby tree can be changed
  into a "Meanie"  which will ultimately force you to teleport. There are 9999
  levels in the game but the next level number is based on the current level +
  how much energy you have remaining. Sentinel Returns is a remake very true to
  the original.
