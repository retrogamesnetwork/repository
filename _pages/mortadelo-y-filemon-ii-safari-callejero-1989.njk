description: The famous crazy-scientist Dr. Bacterio was experimenting with hens
  to let them grow to the size of a horse, thus trying definitively to end the
  hunger in the world.  But, as was habitual in his experiments, he had failed
  in his objective and now a gang of uncontrolled hens is circulating around the
  city putting eggs on the street.  But certain special eggs have the capacity
  to turn one person into a hen (or at least that's what they believed) if the
  egg crushes on his head. Is the sequel of the first game dedicated to the
  famous Ibañez's comicbook saga, "Mortadelo y Filemón", known as "Clever &
  Smart" or "Flip & Flop" outside Spain.
