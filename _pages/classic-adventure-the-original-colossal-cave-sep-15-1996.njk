description: 'Classic Adventure: The Original Colossal Cave! is a version of the
  text adventure game Colossal Cave Adventure developed by Will Crowther and Don
  Woods which has spawned so many copies and variants over the years. This is a
  370-point version that was developed in MS-PDS FORTRAN. It starts, as most
  versions of this game start, "You are standing at the end of a road before
  which is a small brick building. Around you is a forest. A small stream flows
  out of the building and down a gully." The player then explores the
  environment, encountering snakes, dwarves, treasure, traps and usually death.'
