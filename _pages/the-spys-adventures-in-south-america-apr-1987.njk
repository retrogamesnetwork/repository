description: The third addition to the Spy's Adventures series is another
  geographical edutainment title, featuring the same combination of
  international travel and mystery-solving as the previous two installments, and
  similar to the contemporaneous Carmen Sandiego games.  All-around bad guy Dr.
  Xavier Tortion (Dr. X for short) is up to his jewel-thieving antics once
  again, this time in South America, and must be tracked down along with his
  contraband.  The game can be played in single-player mode, or up to 6 players
  may play cooperatively ("spy network") or competitively ("spy vs. spy"). The
  chase starts in a country of the player's choice, with a map of the continent,
  some money, and dossiers with basic information on the various countries.  The
  player can travel from one country to its neighbors on the map.  Each country
  offers at least one site to visit, and investigating the various locations
  will uncover clues to the whereabouts of jewels - informants will also be
  found, who can be paid off with money or jewels to provide crucial clues to
  Dr. X's hiding place.  The goal is to guess his location in no more than 3
  attempts, or he escapes and the quest comes to an end.  If he is caught, a
  score is awarded based on the time taken, jewels recovered, guesses left, and
  letters still not exposed (in the clue to Dr. X's location).
