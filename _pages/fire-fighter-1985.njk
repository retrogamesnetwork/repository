description: "Playing a bit like the reverse of Pyro II, this game puts the
  player in charge of a forest fire response team, combating the spread of
  flare-ups into timberland and cabins using three fire-fighting tools: water
  Drops, Firebreaks, and Backfires, all of which work with varying success
  depending on the regard to the wind speed and direction.  The layouts of
  flashpoints, cabins and fire-thwarting lakes is randomly generated with each
  game; a high score is assigned based on how quickly the player is able to
  control the total damage inflicted by all fires."
