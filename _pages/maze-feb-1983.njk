description: "A simple maze navigation game with randomly-generated screens in
  10 skill levels - 32,000 mazes are possible for each level. The player starts
  at the middle of the left-side wall, and must find a path towards the right
  side of the screen while racing against the clock; helpfully, a trail of dots
  is left behind the player's marker. Being not much more than a programming
  exercise, the game uses a rather crude algorithm to generate the mazes, so the
  lower difficulties will have multiple solutions, while the higher ones may
  have none at all.  For such a contingency, the space bar will generate a new
  maze, though (somewhat unfairly) the clock keeps ticking while this
  happens.  The game was published as a type-in title in PC Magazine, along with
  a write-up that states: \"this program will probably not become a cherished
  family favorite\"."
