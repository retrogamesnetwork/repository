description: Crazy Drake is a side-scrolling action game similar to Earthworm
  Jim, in which the player controls a duck, Crazy Drake, through various levels
  set in six different episodes. One night in LoonVille, Prince Drake was
  playing his favourite video game. Unbeknownst to him, the Evil Dr. FoulBrain
  broke into the palace and stole the Sacred GoldenEgg, which was the source of
  power in the kingdom. Since Prince was to blame for not guarding the egg, he
  knew what had to be done and became Crazy Drake. The game controls like a
  standard side-scrolling platformer. The player's main attack is a gun with
  unlimited ammo and they can find special items that can give them Silver
  Bullets for the gun and a special secondary weapon called SmartBomb. The
  levels are ridden with hidden items like extra lives, first aid items, and
  even items that will teleport the player to hidden and secret levels.
