description: Snood is a puzzle game based on the concept of Puzzle Bobble. The
  game is set out with a grid of small differently-coloured shapes, each
  featuring faces drawn on them. A succession of blocks are placed in an aiming
  device at the bottom of the screen, and you must rotate this so as to aim
  them, off the walls if necessary, to hit ones of the same colour. When three
  or more of the same colour make contact, they are removed from the field of
  play. Any blocks which were only connected to those blocks (and not to any
  others or the ceiling) get removed from play as well. This is crucial, because
  each shot that fails to drop any blocks off causes a meter to move on one
  level. When this reaches the top, the line of blocks drops by one level. Once
  it reaches the point where blocks are moved down below the playing area, it is
  Game Over. There are five skill levels, as well as a set of 50 challenge
  levels, and a Journey mode in which you play through one level from each
  difficulty. From medium difficulty upwards, you'll have to contend with Skulls
  among the layout - these can only be removed by being dropped away.
