description: "The game from Virgin based on the 1992 animated Disney film is a
  side-scrolling platformer. The player controls Aladdin, who must make his way
  through several levels based on locations from the movie: from the streets and
  rooftops of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders and the Sultan's dungeon to the final
  confrontation in Grand Vizier Jafar's palace. The Sultan's guards and also
  animals of the desert want to hinder Aladdin in his way. He can defend himself
  with his sword or by throwing apples. Next to apples, Aladdin can also collect
  gems which can be traded for lives and continues with a traveling trader.
  Finding Genie or Abu icons enables bonus rounds. The Genie bonus round is a
  game of luck played for apples, gems or extra lives. In Abu's bonus round, the
  player controls the little monkey who has to catch bonus items that fall from
  the sky, but without touching any of the unwanted objects like rocks and pots.
  The game's humorous animations were created by Walt Disney Feature Animation."
