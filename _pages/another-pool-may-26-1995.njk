description: Another Pool is a freeware pool game for one or two players. There
  are no sound effects and no player aids such as sight lines. There is an
  'undo' feature and the game does collect performance stats for each player.
  The game uses the mouse to control the strength of the shot, the position in
  which the cue makes contact with the cue ball, and the direction of the shot.
