description: Three magic scrolls must be found in the first part of the
  scrolling hack 'n' slash game, before you can make the journey to defeat your
  foes and rescue the other wizards in the second part. As with so many Dinamic
  games, the two parts are loaded separately, but the second can't be accessed
  until a password (provided at the end of part one) is input. Contact with the
  enemies en route (which are mostly mutant demons) drains your limited energy,
  and you are also working against a time limit on each section. As well as your
  magical powers (which are stronger in part two), you can collect swords to
  attack, as well as lightning bolts which can be collected to destroy all
  enemies on screen. In part two vanquished foes release coins, which can be
  spent at shop sections on rechargers, shields and teleporters amongst other
  things.
