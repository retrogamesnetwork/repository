description: The Bard's Lore is a role-playing adventure created with the Bard's
  Tale Construction Set. Starting in the city of Lorraine, the player must
  assemble a team of adventurers and seek to complete the quest given by the
  king. The game retains the same playing mechanics as the original Bard's Tale
  but uses custom monsters and spells, as allowed by the Construction Set. While
  the game itself was always free, the spellbook and cluebook were originally
  provided only upon paying a registration fee.
