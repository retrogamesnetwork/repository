description: Gettysburg is a one or two player, shareware, computerised version
  of an old-school war-game of this historic battle of the American Civil War.
  The game is played on a hexagonal grid of which the player can see only a part
  while moving their units. A full battlefield view is available but this is an
  overview and units cannot be moved while in this mode. The computer highlights
  each of the players pieces in turn, highlighted pieces flash on and off, and
  the player can make up to four moves per unit using the numeric keypad. Enemy
  units are attacked by moving next to them and attempting to occupy their space
  on the grid. When all the pieces in the current segment of the battlefield
  have been moved the computer switches to the next segment and then the next
  until all the player's units have been moved, then the computer or the second
  player moves their pieces. After each round the player(s) are shown the
  current score and are given the option of saving their game.
