description: "Aliens is a single-screen shooter which features a common setup:
  aliens attack an unnamed planet which is represented by green hills on the
  bottom part of the screen. On these hills there are fortifications which fire
  at the attacker. However, in this game the player controls the alien ship
  instead of the defenders. The ship can be freely moved within the screen and
  shoot bullets straight down. The goal of each level is destroying all
  defenders. The player starts out with five lives which are lost when the ship
  is hit by a bullet or crashes into the hills. After losing a life, the ship
  instantly respawns without losing progress in the current level. The game ends
  when all lives are depleted, but an additional one is gained when progressing
  to the next level. The game simulates inertia and sometimes extras fall from
  the sky which can be picked up before they reach the ground. The level layout
  (the look of the hills and the position of the defenders) varies at each
  start."
