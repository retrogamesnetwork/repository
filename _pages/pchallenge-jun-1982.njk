description: Written as a 16-line BASIC program published in PC Magazine,
  PChallenge may be described as Pong without the second player, or Breakout
  without the bricks, or both.  The player controls a paddle, which can be moved
  along the bottom of the screen to deflect a moving ball and bounce it off the
  walls; lose all ten balls, and it's game over.  The paddle comes in 3
  selectable sizes, and the ball speed is controlled by an adjustable drag
  factor - the longer the game, the faster the action gets.
