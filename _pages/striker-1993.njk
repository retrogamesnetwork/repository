description: Striker is a football (soccer) game with a forced-perspective 3D
  view. The players are drawn large and there is a large scanner to assist with
  long passing. The standard mode has the ball sticking closely to the feet,
  which makes mazy runs upfield a common strategy. There are 64 international
  teams on offer, with a European-style knock-out cup competition included. Many
  different formations and strategies are offered.
