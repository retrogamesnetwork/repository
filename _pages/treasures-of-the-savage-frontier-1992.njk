description: The Heroes of Ascore have been magically summoned to help old
  dwarven allies retake the city of Llorkh from the foul Zhentarim legions.
  After that, there are more dangers that lurk in the wilds of the Savage
  Frontier... The sequel to Gateway to the Savage Frontier is a role-playing
  game using SSI's standard Gold Box gameplay system. You can import existing
  characters from playing the first game. The game is viewed from above, as you
  move your party into mystery, buildings and combat. The game now includes
  weather changes that affect movement and NPC interaction.
