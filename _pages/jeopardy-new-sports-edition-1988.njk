description: Based on the tv game show. Jeopardy! New Sports Edition provides
  the same gameplay as the original Jeopardy!. There are over 1000 answers.
  Categories include everything from the Olympic Sports, such as Gymnastics,
  Swimming and Track to Football, Golf and Baseball. You can play one-on-one
  with the computer, or challenge up to two other sports fans to a game. Three
  players compete against each other by coming up with the question for a given
  answer. There are two rounds of play each with six categories of answers, and
  one final round consisting of a single answer. Each correct question given can
  be worth from $100 to $1000 for the player to respond first, or if a daily
  double is uncovered the player to find it may bet up to the current amount of
  money they have. The player with the most money at the end wins. Jeopardy!
  features a high scores table so players can save their characters wins and
  losses, different male and female character animations to choose from, and of
  course a wide variety of answers and questions. Up to three human players can
  compete, or a combination of human and computer players.
