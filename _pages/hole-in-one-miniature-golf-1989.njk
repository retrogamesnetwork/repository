description: Hole-In-One Miniature Golf provides an overhead view of each hole.
  The game play is controlled entirely with the mouse. You place the ball on the
  starting pad and click the left mouse button. Once you have placed the ball,
  "stretch" a line from the ball to the pointer. The direction the line is
  pointing is the direction the ball will go. The length of the line or the
  distance between the pointer and the ball is relative to the power on the
  shot. Once you are satisfied, click the left mouse button to putt the ball.
  You are allowed to go three shots over par. Any more than that and you will
  get a penalty stroke and must advance to the next hole (or player). You can
  also get one stroke penalty for going into a water hazard. Your scorecard will
  be displayed after the first nine holes but can be viewed at anytime using the
  Options Menu. After completing the course the scorecard will be displayed
  again. You can print your scores or exit to continue. The game features five
  complete 18-hole courses with different themes including a Tutorial Course
  that walks the player through every aspect of game play, a Classics Course
  which is patterned after the basic traditional miniature golf course, an
  Intermediate Course that adds more obstacles, elevations and difficulty, an
  adventurous Fantasy Course with designs ranging from castles to pinball and
  the Expert Course for those who master the game. The game can be installed on
  a hard drive.
