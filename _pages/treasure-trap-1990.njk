description: In 1829 The Esmerelda, a cargo ship carrying gold, sinks to the
  bottom of the ocean. In 1927 a treasure hunter called Howard Kelp dons a
  diving suit and searches for the bullion in the wreck. Treasure Trap is an
  isometric action game similar to Head Over Heels, but less abstract in its
  theme. The player guides the diver in a series of rooms (100 total) where the
  main goal is to collect gold. The main hazard encountered is the sea life that
  occupied the vacant ship. The character has no weapons, but carries a limited
  amount of "smart fishes", trained piranhas that attack and destroy all the
  enemies in the room. Since the player starts with 2 fishes and only receives a
  new one at each 80 gold bars collected, most of the time the enemies have to
  be avoided by staying away or jumping over them. Stacking boxes and other
  objects stops the fauna from getting to the character (and also allows access
  to high places). There's an air gauge that is constantly depleting at the
  bottom-right of the screen. It can be filled with the compressed air tanks
  scattered in some rooms. Some doors require geometric-shaped keys. These can
  be collected and stored in three slots at the bottom-left of the screen. The
  game allows saving at each 50 gold collected.
