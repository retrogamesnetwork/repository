description: ComputerWars is an Artillery clone. The game is played by one
  player vs the computer or by two players. One player takes the part of an IBM
  PC and the other takes the role of a MAC. They each take turns firing floppy
  discs at each other in a cityscape setting. The winner is the person/machine
  that eliminates the other. There is no save game function, no high score
  function, and the game is entirely keyboard controlled.
