description: Tommy's Spades is a shareware card game. In real life this is a
  game for four players playing in teams of two, in this implementation it is a
  single player game with the computer playing both the player's partner and
  both opposition players. The game is played with a standard deck of fifty two
  cards, from that deck the two of diamonds and two of clubs have both been
  replaced by jokers. Briefly, this is a trick taking game where spades are
  always trumps. Players bid individually on the number of tricks, called books
  in this game, they will make. If the player makes their bid number of tricks
  then points  scored for each trick made and each overtrick, if they fail to
  make the number of tricks they bid then penalty points are awarded. One
  notable feature of this game occurs during the deal where up to three rounds
  within a hand can be dealt face up. The game is entirely keyboard controlled.
  It has a demo mode, an open hand mode, basic sound effects and command line
  switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour
  or monochrome display.
