description: This game is based on the pen & paper RPG Tunnels & Trolls. After a
  four hundred year long war, humans and monsters finally signed a peace treaty,
  and harmony returned to the Dragon Land - but not for long. The leader of the
  monsters, the mysterious Lerotra'hh, declared the peace contract was invalid.
  Monsters began to attack human settlements once again. The only one who can
  save the humans is the mighty wizard Khazan. Unfortunately, Khazan was
  imprisoned in his exile. This is where a group of brave adventurers enters the
  picture, determined to rescue Khazan and defeat the evil. The party explores
  the world of Crusaders of Khazan from a top-down perspective, roaming
  wilderness areas, visiting towns, talking to people, receiving quests, and
  descending into dungeons. Battles take place on a top-down battle screen, on
  which characters can move freely and attack enemies in turn-based style. The
  game features point-and-click interface with multiple windows.
