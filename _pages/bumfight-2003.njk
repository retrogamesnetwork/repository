description: "A no-frills QBasic turn-based top-down combat simulator with an
  unusual and controversial theme: bumfights, or otherwise put, combat between
  the homeless!  Their arena is the mean streets, and trashcans become the
  dispensers of various bonuses (feeble improvised weapons and armour) and
  penalties (health deductions from vicious rats! eek!)  Game settings allow for
  play between two to eight human or computer players, with the final winner
  heading to the high score chart with a money count totaling change the player
  found in the garbage and retrieved from the bodies of defeated opponents."
