description: Prehistorik is a side-view platform game with a superficial
  similarity to Chuck Rock. You control a neanderthal who must march through
  hostile pre-historic environments seeking food and keeping himself safe. Some
  food can be found in caves, but it mainly exists in living animal forms. These
  include fire-breathing Pyro-Tax dragons, the Turtosaurus, and the Bad Bat.
  Each of these must be clubbed to death, some taking up to 5 hits, and then
  walked over. Some other enemies are indestructible, with the monkeys who throw
  coconuts at you particularly fiendish. You will have to complete the level
  within the time limit, and avoid contact with these foes. However, bombs and
  improved weapons can be collected, as can extra lives, time bonuses and an
  improved jump.
