description: "The Avatar, the embodiment of the Eight Virtues and the hero of
  Britannia, is called back to deal with a grave threat. Lord British, the
  country's benevolent monarch, has disappeared, and a man named Blackthorn has
  usurped his throne. The tyrant rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon
  the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. His
  fundamentalist visions led him to create a police state, where failure to
  adhere to the virtues is punishable by death. Behind Blackthorn are the three
  Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage.
  The Avatar must understand their meaning and origins, find a way to defeat
  them, rescue Lord British, and restore the former ethical principles of
  Britannia. Ultima V uses the basics of the Ultima IV engine, an overhead
  perspective for the map of Britannia and its towns, and a rosette-compass 3D
  view for the dungeons. The battle system also resembles that of the previous
  game, with separate battle screens and navigation of character icons in
  turn-based style. Many of the gameplay elements of the predecessor return,
  including the complex spell system (reagents must be bought in order to cast
  spells), recruitable party members, moongates that teleport the party between
  locations, various means of transportation (horses, ships, etc., with the
  notable addition of a magic carpet), and so on. Character creation based on
  morally ambiguous questions and basic leveling up system have been preserved
  as well. In comparison to the predecessor, the classes have been reduced to
  four. Additional challenges include navigating characters through the
  Underworld, a vast underground area containing many hazards; random presence
  of Shadowlords in the cities, which influences the behavior of their
  inhabitants, making them run away, steal from, or attack the Avatar;
  inscriptions in a runic alphabet that must be deciphered by the player, and
  others. The game has a noticeably more detailed world than any of its
  predecessors; the towns are much larger, with many unique buildings and
  objects represented graphically. Ultima V introduces physical interaction with
  the game world: many objects can be pushed or pulled, the main character can
  sit down on a chair (which is graphically shown), etc. It also incorporates a
  day/night cycle and schedules for non-playable characters: for example, it is
  impossible to shop at night because the shopkeepers are sleeping. Dialogues
  with NPCs have been enhanced, featuring more unique and detailed conversation
  topics."
