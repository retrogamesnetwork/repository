description: As Players Software correctly predicted, London in 1995 is an
  unfriendly unsafe city ran by thugs. Innocent civilians who leave the house
  will almost certainly face violence. An acclaimed hero since his successes in
  the original, Joe Blade is the man to put things right - if he can kill 100
  thugs and rescue 20 civilians within ten minutes, the thugs will retreat and
  the city will be saved. As Joe, you must move through the streets and kill
  these thugs, by kicking them in the head (they have body armour). As in the
  first game, the streets are flick-screen and have many doorways linking them.
  Rescuing civilians involves touching them before completing a sub-game within
  a minute. There are four subgame variants of increasing difficulty, all based
  around a 1-2-3-4 sequence of numbers. The first involves simply stopping the
  cursor as each one appears in order - pressing the wrong one sends you back to
  having to find a 1. In the second, the numbers are on screen in random order,
  a cursor cycling through them - press fire to swap the two numbers currently
  highlighted. In the third, you are presented with two jumbled sets and must
  put one of them in order, by swapping numbers across the two sets. In the
  fourth, you must form the sequence by swapping an ever-changing number into
  the right place, by pressing fire at the right moment.
