description: Operation Market Garden is a recreation of the largest daylight
  airborne operation in history on September 17, 1944. As commander of the
  Allied forces you will direct the American  82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions,
  the British 1st Airborne Division and the 30th Corps to their historical
  objectives. The Allied player earns points for controlling and keeping supply
  objective hexes. They lose points for overrun airborne supply hexes and German
  controlled town/city hexes. The level of victory (5 levels) is determined by
  Allied points at the end of the game. The game can be played by 2 people or
  solitaire (computer as German), has four levels of difficulty and can be
  played as either intermediate level or advanced. Playing time is 10 hours.
