description: Wreckers is an isometric sci-fi action game with strategy elements.
  Robotic droids roll quietly through the corridors of space station Beacon
  04523N, automated computers calculate routes for interstellar traffic. Three
  human officers sleep in cryogenic tanks, awakened only for routine system
  checks – or in case of an emergency. With a hum, the cryogenic control springs
  on-line as Beacon’s long-range sensors detect incoming lifeforms. Controlling
  one of the on-board officers, the player has to defend the station against
  swarms of plasmodian spores (the “Wreckers”) showering down on Beacon and
  seeping into its four sections. While the spores approach, they can be sucked
  out of space with a gigantic hoover-like space hose. Once they settle onto the
  stations hull, jump into the space suit and spray infected areas with a
  cleansing agent. Undetected spores will seep into the station’s corridors,
  where the protagonist must hunt them down with a plasma shots and avoid being
  shot in return. In addition, up to ten droids are under the player's indirect
  control. Ranging from cleaners to fighters to engineers, these automatons will
  act independently, but can be sent to key locations within the station -- i.e.
  infected areas. As the officer gains experience through battles, he will be
  promoted to higher ranks, enabling him to construct more efficient fighter
  robots in the station’s droid factory. Since plasmodians running rampant in
  the station will cause system malfunctions. The main goal in such cases is to
  clear infections quickly and make sure that Beacon continues to function
  properly. To make things worse, a self-destruct mechanism will detonate the
  station in sixty minutes unless all signs of spore activity cease.
