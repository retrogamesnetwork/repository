description: In Blow Up! the player takes on the role of Joe Kowalski who must
  navigate his way to the exit in six progressively more difficult caverns. The
  game has similar gameplay as Boulder Dash, and each cavern must be completed
  within five minutes. Along the way, Joe will encounter various enemies. There
  are grabbers who will jump on Joe and slow him down. Darth Vader heads who
  move around more quickly and will shoot at you. Walking grenades will explode
  when you come too close to them. The green virus will spread around when it is
  unleashed and it will make you sick when you come into contact with it. Joe
  will turn pale white, his energy will drain and he can only move around
  slowly. Joe can fight back by dropping rocks onto them, or by shooting them or
  by using mines to blow up enemies or walls.
