description: "In Air Force Commander the player takes command of a Middle
  Eastern country's air force to gain air superiority over the enemy. Like the
  title suggests this game focuses solely on aircraft and rocket bases. The main
  part of the game is spent on the overhead map where the player gives orders to
  his units, e.g. attacking ground targets and scouting or intercepting enemy
  forces. Different map views show information like targets in range, flight
  movements in the monitored zones or civil facilities. Another important aspect
  of the game is resource management: every base and unit cost resources. If
  these get scarce the player can shut down some bases. If the public mood gets
  too bad, e.g. because of destroyed civil facilities or food shortage, the
  player loses his commission and therefore the game."
