description: Fox Ranger is a side scrolling space shooter from Korea. There are
  6 stages with an end-boss at the end of each stage. The gameplay is simply
  shoot-anything-that-moves and there are lots of enemies on screen to shoot
  down. Press CTRL to fire the standard weapon and ALT to use the extra weapon,
  which is shown in a box at the top of the screen. When you die and your
  standard weapon is powered-up you don't lose it, instead it is powered-down,
  so you still have at least something. You can select level easy, normal or
  hard to start with 7, 5 or 3 ships. And you can set the shield to easy, normal
  or hard to start with 9, 6 or 3 shield units.
