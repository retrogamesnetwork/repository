description: DND is the seminal mainframe classic, which started computer
  role-playing games. The name of the game clearly comes from the Dungeons and
  Dragons (D&D) pen and paper role playing systems, and it uses D&D rules.
  Further inspired by Pedit5, the game itself is a classic dungeon crawl. It
  could be counted as a "rogue-like" but doesn't have random dungeons. DND lets
  you generate your character by randomly rolling attributes (Strength,
  Intelligence, Wisdom, Constitution, Dexterity and Charisma) and then select
  one of three classes (Cleric, Fighter or Magician, the first and last are able
  to cast spells). You then may visit the store where you can buy armour,
  weapons etc. -- of course, at the very beginning of the game you have no money
  to spend! Finally, you have a choice of five dungeons to enter, each one with
  several levels. The dungeons are depicted by a top-down text-graphics view.
  You only see the surrounding 3x3 squared of the current level. During
  exploring, you may encounter monsters which you battle in a very simplistic
  turn-based fight (you only have the options of Attacking and Evading). If you
  defeat the monster, you gain experience (sometimes resulting in upgrading a
  level), and some monsters also leave some treasure. Other treasures are
  randomly strewn in the dungeon, but beware! Some of them are protected by
  traps. Other sites you can get along are altars (where you can pray or spend
  money to get divine protection), books (which randomly change your
  attributes), fountains with random effects, wands which let you cast spells
  even as a fighter or Dragon's Lairs containing lot of loot, protected by a
  mighty dragons. There are also teleporters which may randomly zap you to some
  other part of the dungeon. The game offers no possibility to save your
  character -- when you die, it is as if your character never existed! So make
  sure to leave the dungeon often to buy the best possible equipment.
