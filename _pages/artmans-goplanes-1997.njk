description: "Goplanes is a four-way scrolling shooter inspired by Sopwith,
  which puts you at the controls of an old-school, early 20th century fighter
  plane with the general objective of blowing things up.  Your aircraft is
  capable of flashy (but useful) moves - climbing, diving, flipping over and
  making 360-degree turns; enemy fire can take it out in three hits, but so can
  the ground.  In addition to the basic frontal mounted gun, various weapons can
  be collected for more firepower: missiles, spread shots and dropbombs. Three
  missions are included: first off, you'll have to find and destroy some oil
  containers; then it's on to taking down some zeppelins, and finally, a
  snowstorm battle against a heavy artillery unit.  As in Sopwith, there are
  innocent bystanders too, but here you actually gain points by gunning down the
  poor saps... whether human or animal."
