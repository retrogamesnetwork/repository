description: Bert's Dinosaurs is a single player, shareware, colouring game for
  young children. This game offers the child the opportunity to create pictures
  using pre-drawn templates and figures. As each animal is selected its name is
  displayed in big letters and a voice says its name. The animals come in four
  different sizes  and are dragged into position with the mouse at which point
  they can be coloured. The game also has a Story function to caption their
  pictures, a save/load function and a print function. The image file for this
  game was also sold as an add-on pack to Bert's African Animals
