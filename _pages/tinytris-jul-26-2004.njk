description: 'TinyTris approximates the Game Boy version of Tetris as a PC game
  in less than 3 KB.  It only implements the classic game mode, known as
  "A-type" in the Game Boy version: move, rotate and drop the falling 4-piece
  blocks, stack them in a pile at the bottom of the pit, and form complete
  horizontal lines to eliminate them for points.  The action speeds up on each
  new level, but instead of leveling up every ten lines, the proverbial kick up
  the arse arrives at increasing intervals - you advance a level when your line
  count is a power of two, which means that the difficulty ramp is more
  gradual.'
