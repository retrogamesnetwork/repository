description: The very first game by Villa Crespo Software, founded by Dan Sejzer
  in Highland Park, IL. 'Real Poker' bears the name of professional gambler
  'Amarillo Slim' (Thomas Preston), better known by his 'appearance' in later
  products of the same company, Amarillo Slim Dealer's Choice and Amarillo
  Slim's 7 Card Stud. As could be seen from the title, Amarillo Slim‚Äôs Real
  Poker ‚Äì Five Card Stud presents but one variety of poker, 5 card stud. There
  is no graphics, as everything including the cards is pictured by text symbols,
  but the game features friendly interface, extensive help system and such
  options as 'tutor' and 'odds' aimed at assisting the novice players. Only one
  of four participants could be human, but there is a possibility to disable one
  or two extra computer opponents.
