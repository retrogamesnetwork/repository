description: Omega casts the player into the role of a cyber-tank designer and
  programmer. The goal is to design a powerful tank capable of defeating
  opponents within the frames of a limited budget. A successful completion of
  this task grants the player character a higher security clearance and a large
  budget. Combat plays little to no role in the game; the gameplay is dedicated
  to designing the tanks themselves. The player programs tanks by using a
  built-in text editor. It is possible to assign different artificial
  intelligence script commands that control various aspects of the tank, as well
  as enable communication between several tanks in a group. The player must take
  into account the equipment of a tank and its attributes in order to design a
  vehicle that would prove successful in combat.
