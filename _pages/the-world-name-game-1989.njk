description: The World Name Game is a single player, shareware, educational game
  based on capitals of the world as they were in 1990. This is a simple keyboard
  driven game in which the player is presented with an outline map, which
  may/may not have surrounding countries and/or cities to give a clue. The
  target city which the player must identify is shown as a dot within a circle
  and the player must type in the correct spelling of that city. The game can be
  used to test the player on cities around the world or on just US cities. The
  game can be played in three modes where the player has to identify either US
  cities, world capitals, or world capitals or their countries. There are also
  study modes where the target cities can be displayed on a map so that the
  player can study and memorise them.
