  One of the world's first chess games designed for experts, Cyrus is also
  unfortunately one of the least known due to limited distribution. The IBM
  version can be played from a isometric 3-D perspective, or a traditional
  boring 2-D overhead view. There is a clock, which can be turned on or off.

  You can view analysis mode, examine game, or watch the computer play itself. The game has 16 difficulty levels!
