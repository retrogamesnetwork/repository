description: "In the game you as manager of Basketball team start your career
  with a budget of $9,000,000. The gameplay includes the economical management
  of the team and playing the baseketball game itself on the field. In
  management phase the player has to buy a team of 8 players, and assign 5 of
  them for a match. The price of players differs based on their skill and
  experience. The experience is described by two parameters: Rookie and Veteran,
  and skills are described by four parameters: SP (Running speed), SK (Skill in
  getting set for taking shot), ST (Stamina), SH (Shooting ability). Starting
  with the rookies the player will eventually progress to a solid team of
  veterans. In simulation phase the matches need to be won with the assigned
  players on the field, against another team. The player controls one of the
  team players, the one holding the ball a ball, or  the one currently near the
  ball, moving him in eight directions, trying to get the ball, or throwing the
  ball. The game is available for 1-2 players."
