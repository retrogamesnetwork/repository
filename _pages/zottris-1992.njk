description: Zottris is a single player, shareware, falling block game. Square
  blocks fall from the top of the screen to the bottom. When they hit the bottom
  of the screen the player can destroy them but they cannot be destroyed in
  flight. Destroying blocks costs the player Zot points which can only be
  replenished by generating a row of the same colour bricks which disappear and
  score the player points. As the player's point total increases they advance to
  another level, the gameplay remains the same but the background colour changes
  and the blocks appear and fall at a faster rate. The game ends when the bricks
  reach the top of the screen. The game has optional sound but has no save/load
  or high score functions.
