description: KaleidoKubes is a puzzle game where players places cubes on a
  board. The game is meant for two players, either against a human or against
  the computer, but there is also a practice mode for one player. Each cube is
  split into four triangles of different colours (blue, green, red, yellow) and
  to place one on the board the colour of each side has to match the colours of
  adjacent cubes. Each cube has to connect to at least one other cube. The
  players earn points for each cube that is placed on the board and the more
  sides that are connected the more points will be earned. The game is turn
  based and each player has a limited time (30 or 60 seconds depending on
  settings) and when it's out the player gets a point penalty and the opponent
  takes over. For each turn the player has just one cube which can be rotated
  and if he can't find a solution it's possible to pass. The winner is the
  player with the highest score when the board is filled or when two consecutive
  combinations of time running out or passes have been made.
