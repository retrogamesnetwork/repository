description: You start as a member of the 1988 U.S. Olympic Team to compete at
  the Olympic Summer Games. You can play eight events, including Velodrome
  Sprint Cycling, Hurdles, Pole Vault, Hammer-throw, Uneven Parallel Bars,
  Rings, Archery, and Springboard Diving. You can practice each event separately
  or play the whole competition. The game also features a multiple player
  option, this makes it a nice party game. If you are alone, you can compete
  against the computer. If you're stuck in an event, or want to get better, just
  take the coaching book (= the manual) and read how you can make more tricks.
  It also features many real facts of the history of the Olympic summer games.
