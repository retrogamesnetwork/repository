  Airstrike is a sidescrolling shooter featuring an Apache-like helicopter,
  taking part in a series of missions in a war between the 'North Atlantic
  Defence Alliance' and a country called 'Dosnovia'.


  You primary base is on an aircraft carrier off shore from Dosnovia, and you are given specific targets to take out during a mission. The enemy consists of soldiers carrying missiles, gunboats, AA guns, radar stations and missile batteries placed in and around the ordinary houses and woods inland, and a selective approach is recommended to gain most points on each mission. Bombing innocent trees counts as wanton destruction, and gives negative scores. The map wraps around after a stretch of land, and you end up back over your carrier, where you can land and automatically replenish your missile supplies and repair the helicopter if damaged.


  After completing a mission, you get a debriefing with positive citations and negative reprimands, if you damaged other than the enemy.


  If you fail a mission, you get an option to retry it. Giving up sends you halfway back to start from where you were in the mission list.


  There is a total of 21 missions in the game, which originally was intended as a sprite demo, but evolved into a full shareware game.
