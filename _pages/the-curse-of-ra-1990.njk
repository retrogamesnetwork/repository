description: The Curse of RA is a puzzle game where the player (Scarab) has to
  escape a pyramid by solving the riddles. The player needs to remove all stones
  on a board by finding a counterpart. Only two stones with the same symbol can
  be removed at a time and they have to be on a straight line, horizontally or
  vertically. The game starts with Scarab on an ankh and that item has to be
  returned upon completion. Moving a stone is done by sitting on one and moving
  it towards the counterpart. Not all stones can be moved however and there are
  teleporters, obstructions and diversions to make it more difficult. There are
  also traps and for instance ice that forces Scarab to move in a single
  direction. When the stones are aligned, pressing fire matches them and they
  disappear. The game can be played in a Logic or in an Arcade mode. Logic mode
  offers 100 levels with no time limit. Special stones can make the player‚Äôs
  life easier or harder. In Arcade mode the player has to complete a level
  within a certain amount of time. Special coins can be used to buy extras after
  each level, such as ability to fly for 30 seconds, more time, extra lives and
  others. Levels are generated at random. The Arcade mode has a high score
  table. Demo mode shows the usage of all the different stones found in the
  game. This is a sort of non-playable tutorial. The game also provides a level
  editor.
