description: General Trivia is a shareware, or "try before you buy", quiz game
  for up to four players. This is a 'Trivia Shell' game meaning that the basic
  software can be applied to many different subjects by changing the load screen
  and question packs. The game has three levels of difficulty which it applies
  to the same question pack. For example given the question "Who was the first
  president of the US to win a Nobel peace Prize?" on the Beginner setting the
  player would be given the answer and True/False buttons; on the Intermediate
  setting the player would be given four choices; and on the Advanced setting
  the player would have to type in the complete answer. With multiplayer games
  it is possible to have players on different difficulty settings - useful when
  parents are playing against children for example. The game has a hint feature
  and a high score table that shows the top five scores for each difficulty
  setting. If the player answers five correct questions in a row they are
  rewarded with a bonus question. Games can be configured to be any length, the
  default is thirty questions, and can be restricted to particular topics. There
  is an optional hint feature. The shareware game has just 105 questions while
  the registered games have either three hundred (Classic), six hundred (Deluxe)
  or a thousand questions (Gold).
