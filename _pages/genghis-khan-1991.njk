description: Genghis Khan is basically a strategy game, but not just. A very
  important part of your ability as governor will depend on your arcade
  experience when it comes to conquering the territories surrounding Mongolia.
  You mission will be to invade the Chinese Empire, and for that you must tear
  down the Great Wall using gunpowder. Unfortunately it will not be available
  from the beginning, so you will have to conquer Baghdad where the secrets of
  gunpowder manufacture are kept, and then dedicate your task in destroying the
  barrier that prevents you from the victory. But it will not be that easy, you
  will also have to defeat several enemies of varying difficulty. The game makes
  you choose between arcade, strategy or a mixture of both. In the first
  category you must use the joystick to defeat the owner of the chosen land. The
  screen turns into a side-scrolling game in which a Mongol warrior, sword in
  hand, must face the enemy hordes. Each soldier you kill equalizes to five in
  total, and every blow you receive means a loss of five units of yours.
