description: A simple head-to-head deathmatch between two spaceships. You can
  choose two powerups from a selection that includes a variety of missiles,
  shields, and cloaking devices, then battle against a computer AI or human
  player, ranging in difficulty from "sitting duck" to "very dangerous". The
  physics are highly simplified, with both spaceships quickly reaching a maximum
  speed and then continuing to coast at that speed until they change direction.
  Since the playing field wraps around and is empty of all obstacles, this
  allows both ships to cruise onward indefinitely.
