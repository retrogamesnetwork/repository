description: Fight as either Red Beard or One Eye through various pirate themed
  levels, like ships and forts, and even some non-pirate themed levels, battling
  ninjas, skeletons, and others in a quest to get back your hard earned money
  from an evil wizard. You can also fight side by side with a friend (who
  controls the pirate you didn't choose). Fighting works like fencing, with a
  few different moves to use, including parrying. The levels scroll through with
  a boss at the end of each. You gain money by vanquishing foes and digging for
  treasure where X marks the spot.
