description: "Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds takes place one year
  after the events of Ultima VII: The Black Gate. To celebrate the defeat of the
  Guardian, Lord British invites the Avatar and his companions to his castle.
  However, in the night of the feast the Guardian attacks again, encasing the
  castle in a giant gem of blackrock. Deep in the sewers of the castle, another
  blackrock gem is found, created as an aftereffect of the attack. This gem is a
  teleporter to other worlds controlled by the Guardian. Now the Avatar must
  travel to these worlds in order to free the castle from the Guardian's spell.
  This sequel to Ultima Underworld plays almost exactly as the original, with
  its 3D world, action-oriented combat, magic system and multiple-choice
  conversations. The player creates the character of Avatar, choosing gender,
  class, and initial skills. These range from weapon proficiencies to social
  abilities such as diplomacy and bartering. Some of the skills can be increased
  during the course of the game by visiting trainers. After having accumulated a
  sufficient amount of experience points, the Avatar levels up, and his hit
  points and mana are increased. Like its predecessor, the game features an
  interactive world: many objects can be manipulated and physically moved. The
  game's storyline is more connected to the main Ultima series than that of its
  predecessor, and the game world is larger and has more variety: besides the
  usual castles and dungeons there are such diverse locations as an ice world,
  an alien place called Talorus and the enigmatic Ethereal Void. Graphics and
  sound have also been improved: the size of the viewing window has been
  increased, there are new monster graphics and the game now features digitized
  sound effects."
