description: "Snipes is an arcade style action game. You are in a large maze
  along with a number of generators. The generators create the enemy Snipes, and
  to win the game you need to shoot all of the generators and all of the Snipes
  they create. The game is played using two sets of four keys, one set to move
  and one to fire; this allows you to both move and fire in eight different
  directions, and you aren't limited to firing in the same direction you are
  facing (similar to the controls in games such as Robotron: 2084). The Snipes
  are armed as well, and will be firing back at you! If you lose all of your
  lives, the game ends and the Snipes win. There are numerous skill levels
  available; in the higher levels the snipes are more numerous, more aggressive,
  and the maze walls become deadly to touch."
