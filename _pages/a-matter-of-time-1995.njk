description: In A Matter of Time, the player takes the role of Jonathan Stone
  who is the assistant of Dr. Joseph Adams. Adams was competing with Dr. Karl
  Evers about government funds for a time travel machine. Shortly before the
  deadline elapses, Evers is murdered, Adams becomes the prime suspect and
  suddenly disappears. As it turns out, he used his time machine in order to
  find proof of god's existence. Stone's adventure begins when he also uses the
  machine and find himself in the time of dinosaurs... This is an interactive
  fiction game with graphics, although the graphics are loaded and shown
  separately from the text interface. They usually show up when Stone enters a
  new location or uses the "look" command. The player interacts with the game by
  typing in commands, e.g. "take box", which is then interpreted by the parser
  and followed by a text response. The game is spent with exploring the
  environment, picking up items and solving puzzles.
