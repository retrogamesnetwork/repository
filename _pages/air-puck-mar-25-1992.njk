description: Air Puck is a shufflepuck game, where you try to slide a hockey
  puck on a small table, past a computer opponent at the opposite end. The
  playing table is drawn as vector grid, as seen from a human players position,
  in a linear perspective. The players bat is controlled by the mouse, and can
  only move within a small area close to the bottom to defend the own goal. At
  the outset, you configure the game to how many goals to aim for to win, and
  how fast the puck will glide. The DOS version was inspired by an earlier Apple
  Macintosh shareware release of the same name, made by another author.
