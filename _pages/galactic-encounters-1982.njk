description: "Galactic Encounters is a turn-based, command-driven strategy game
  in the mold of Star Trek, although it dispenses with the Klingons and Romulans
  in favor of the less-infringing \"Kaons\" and \"Omegans\", respectively.  The
  player is in command of the Illiad, a star cruiser in the fleet of the
  Consortium of Planets, charged with protecting the galaxy (a 8x8 grid of 10x10
  sectors) from the aforementioned nefarious threats. To win, all Kaon ships
  must be eliminated within the allotted time. As in most Trek games, the ship
  has various functions - shields, phasers, photon torpedos, ion engines,
  hyperdrive - which consume energy. Energy (and ammunition) may be restocked at
  one of the starbases scattered throughout the region.  This variant adds a few
  twists: starbases may be destroyed by enemies; vital systems may be damaged in
  battle (requiring rest for repairs); energy-replenishing dilithium crystals
  can be mined on planets (risking the crew). Finally, the Illiad is equipped
  with a doomsday weapon, the Z-Ray, which deals stupefying amounts of damage
  and can utterly destroy every enemy in the sector. The catch? - it is highly
  unstable, and has better odds of destroying the player's ship along with
  everybody else."
