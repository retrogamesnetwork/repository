description: This point and click adventure takes a fantasy setting in which the
  player acts as a wizard called Ween, deemed to be "good", taking on a less
  good one. To fulfill the titular prophecy the wizard has been given a limited
  time of three days during which he must go on a quest, solving various puzzles
  along the way, to be rewarded with three grains of sand, that he must place in
  an hourglass what eventually will result in killing an evil wizard. Objects
  around the levels are always detected by the cursor, making each screen and
  the challenges quick to comprehend. Like the company's Gobliins Series, the
  interface is simplified, and the game has a heavier focus on self-sufficient
  puzzles than other traditional adventures. The game experiments with the
  toning of the graphics, using a faux-sepia style outside and some bright
  colours inside, which changes the atmosphere somewhat. As one of not many
  titles of those days, two times during the game, the player makes a choice of
  taking one of the paths which results in different puzzles to be solved.
