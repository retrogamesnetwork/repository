description: In McMurphy's Mansion, a text based adventure, you are the
  nephew/niece of the late eccentric millionaire McMurphy. Upon arriving in
  Scotland, McMurphy's lawyer Barrister Aaron McBee informs you that McMurphy
  has left behind a huge inheritance ($10,000,000), but in order to claim it you
  must prove yourself worthy. McMurphy has left you with only one clue (a small
  brass key) and you must now search the mansion and surrounding grounds for the
  rest of your fortune. Gameplay is similar to other text based adventures like
  Zork, in that you type in what action you would like to perform (like LOOK
  SOUTH or UNLOCK BOX WITH KEY), and then the game tells you the results of your
  action. Along with the text descriptions, there is a map and inventory listing
  to aid you in your quest (these must be turned on before use).
