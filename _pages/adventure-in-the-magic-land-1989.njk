description: Adventure in the Magic Land is a donationware interactive fiction
  game. The player is put into a fantasy scenario (although there are some
  references to modern/future times to be found, e.g. a computer or a spaceship)
  without a specific goal. The first course of action is exploring the
  environment and finding out what should be done. Later the player has to solve
  inventory puzzles in order to win the game. The locations are arranged on a
  8x8 grid and include instant death places, but later the player gains the
  ability to fly which allows to enter the grids unharmed. The starting location
  is random. The description of the location at hand always stays on top of the
  screen. The player interacts with the game by entering verb-noun combinations
  which may or not result in a useful response. When entering another location,
  the whole screen is refreshed and a list of the interactive objects is
  displayed. Distributed along with the game is a text file with a map and
  hints.
