description: "Snakes is a Tandy 1000 BASIC game firmly in the 'arena collector'
  tradition: you control a continuously-moving critter roaming a fenced-off
  area, whose task is to pick up as many collectibles as possible without dying
  in the process.  To survive, it is enough to avoid the edges of the playfield
  and the spiky, sharp-looking protrusions strewn throughout it.  The title may
  lead one to expect a Snake-type game where the creature's body grows as it
  feeds; this is not so -- your on-screen incarnation always occupies a single
  grid position.  Only one level is included, and you're granted five lives to
  make the most of it."
