description: For reasons undisclosed, the Earth is under attack by missles (sic)
  from another planet.  As the unexplainably-hostile aliens rain down
  devastation from the sky, it's your job to stop the warheads from striking the
  surface.  Enemy projectiles appear at the top of the screen, and weave a
  somewhat random path towards the bottom.  There, you must intercept them with
  your ABMs, which can only be moved left or right (somewhat like a Pong paddle,
  but one step at a time). 20 "missles" are fired on each attack wave, and you
  must stop at least 10 to qualify.  The going gets tougher as you advance, and
  later in the game, a faster type of rocket makes its appearance -- worth
  double the points when destroyed.
