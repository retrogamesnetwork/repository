description: Four Indoor Sports are compiled in this entry to DesignStar 's
  SportTime line of recreations. Ten-Pin Bowling, Air Hockey (not on the
  Commodore 16), Darts and  Ping Pong (not on the European Commodore 64
  releases) are featured. The menus and options screens have the same feel as
  Clubhouse Sports. Each game has computer opponents at multiple skill levels
  plus human-versus-human and demo modes, and matches can consist of varying
  numbers of rounds, with other options depending on the game. Ten-pin bowling
  is played from a side-on view, although once the shot has been taken you see
  the results unfold from the bowler's view. There are three stages to taking a
  shot. Move the player up and down to line up his run-up, pressing fire to set
  the position. Then, do the same to set the angle of the shot. Finally, after
  pressing fire to start the run-up, press it again to time the release of the
  ball, as close to the line as possible. Darts has 4 skill and 3 speed levels,
  and players can play to 301, 501 or 701, to vary game length or provide a
  handicapping system. You can also set whether scoring must start or end with a
  double. Viewed from behind the board, you must first line up the dart, then
  set the dart's curvature and power by stopping a curved gauge on the right,
  then a rising power bar on the left. The view then changes twice - first a
  behind-the-player view to show the dart's approach, then a close-up of the
  board to show where it landed. Air Hockey plays for five minutes, or until
  someone has scored 12 points. The view is above the pitch but angled so as to
  emphasize the goal at the top. Ping-Pong features a handicapping system - six
  ability areas can be graded from 1-5, to ensure a closely-matched game. Again
  the view is from behind one court. To impart direction onto a shot, the angle
  must be pressed at the same time as the fire button.
