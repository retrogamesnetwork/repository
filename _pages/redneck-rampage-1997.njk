description: Redneck Rampage is a pseudo-3D first person shooter much like Duke
  Nukem 3D, with 2D sprites for enemies and other objects. In fact, it uses the
  same Build engine as Duke Nukem 3D. Redneck Rampage also has a singularly
  unique setting... instead of taking place in an alien installation or secret
  government facility, the game is set in the backwater small town of Hickston,
  Arkansas. It seems that a bunch of tabloid leather-fetish cyborg aliens have
  abducted the town's stereotypical redneck inhabitants and cloned them. The
  aliens have also abducted Bessie, the prize pig of brothers Leonard and Bubba.
  As Leonard you'll have to fight the local yokel clones as well as the aliens
  throughout Hickston to rescue your pig. The 'Redneck' theme is used very
  heavily. Levels range from trailer parks to chicken processing plants, and the
  arsenal of odd weapons include a gun that shoots circular saws, a TNT
  crossbow, and even a machine gun bra. Also, instead of armor and health kits,
  you restore health and become tougher by drinking whisky and eating pork
  rinds. But if you drink too much you go into "drunk mode" with blurred vision
  and stumbling movement.
