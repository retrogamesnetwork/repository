description: "Pinball Wizard 2000 from Ikarion Software GmbH is the successor of
  Kingsoft's Pinball Wizard for the Amiga. This pinball game features five
  tables (Themes: Industrial Revolution, Hattrick, Rock'n'Roll Heaven,
  Prohibition, Earth Inferno) and one bonus table (Mystic). PW2000 is more of an
  action-oriented game instead of a real simulation since the physics are
  somewhat strange at times. But the real strength of the program is the
  implemented Pinball Construction Set. All tables were built with this
  construction set and with the detailed instruction manual and samples everyone
  with some programming knowledge can do some amazing tables on his own."
