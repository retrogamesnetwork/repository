description: "TetRAM is a small, memory-resident (TSR) Tetris game: working
  around the single-tasking nature of DOS, it loads itself into RAM and can be
  started later at any time.  The first commercial Tetris had already included
  such a feature, but this version achieves other goals: a tiny memory footprint
  (4KB plus change), and the ability to play without suspending the background
  program. When invoked (from a 80x25 text-mode screen), the program greys out
  the current background, and starts a Tetris game on top of it.  The familiar
  rules apply: falling blocks can be moved, rotated and arranged to create solid
  horizontal lines across the pit; full lines are eliminated, and the pile must
  be kept from growing all the way to the top. The game keeps count of completed
  lines, and the more you score - the faster it gets. Meanwhile the background
  program continues to run, and can even receive input, except for the four
  cursor keys used by the game."
