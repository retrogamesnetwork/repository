description: This game combines four popular children's card games into one
  program.  For solitaire fun, it offers Memory Match, the classic "flip the
  cards and look for matching pairs" challenge.  For play against a computer
  opponent, it provides Old Maid, Go Fish and Slapjack.  The first two of these
  barely need explanation, but Slapjack is slightly less well-known.  In it,
  players take turns laying down cards.  If a Jack is played, the first player
  to slap it takes the whole pile of cards.  The winner is whichever player
  manages to collect the whole deck.  Because of the element of reflexes to this
  game, adjustable difficulty levels are provided to modify the computer's
  reaction speed.
