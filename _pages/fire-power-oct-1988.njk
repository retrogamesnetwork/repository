description: A top-down view of two tanks battling it out trying to blast their
  way into each other's fortress. Guns, helicopters, and I can never forget the
  little "splut" sound the PC speaker made every time your tank ran over an
  infantry man.... One of the central gameplay ideas of the game was to play
  head to head with someone else, either via a split screen, modem, or null
  modem cable.
