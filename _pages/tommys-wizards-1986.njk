  Tommy's Wizards is a single player, shareware, intriguing piece of whimsy.
  This is one of those games that doesn't explain itself and to is left to the
  player to decide whether it's a game a time filling piece of nonsense or
  whether it's one of Tommy's joke programs. Being an alien and thus knowing
  about such things, Tommy tells us that this is not really a game, it is the
  universal test for magic and Extra Sensory Perception. After entering their
  name and their trump card the game begins. It is a contest between the player
  on the left and Tommy's wizards on the right. The object of the game is to
  move the magical force field/power bar all the way over to the right thus
  overpowering the wizards, the puzzle is how to do it. The documentation
  suggests that the player may win by staring at the screen and moving the force
  field by sheer willpower, by making appropriate mystic gestures or by saying
  certain magic slogans. Alternatively magic words can be typed into the
  computer and, during the struggle, some words do appear at the bottom of the
  screen, there's often a 3x3 matrix of numbers in the top right corner of the
  screen too, but whether entering information from either of these helps or
  hinders the player is not explained. There is a high score table which records
  the highest running score after each round. 

  As with most of Tommy's games it uses character graphics and is entirely keyboard controlled. It has basic sound effects and command line switches to start the game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display.
