description: Galaxi is a shareware shoot 'em up arcade style game which is a
  homage to the classic game Galaxian. The object of the game is to achieve a
  high score. Gameplay is very much in the style of the old arcade games. The
  cursor keys move the player's ship from side to side while the Space bar fires
  the main weapon. The enemy ships, however, attack in the style of the enemies
  in Galaxian, swooping around the screen as they attack. When a wave of enemy
  ships has been cleared the player's stats are displayed and the next wave
  begins. The game maintains a high score table.
