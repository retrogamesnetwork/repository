  NewTrek (1982) hacked to show the title as Space Trek and unable to show instructions.

  Space Attackers II (1985) called Invaders in the menu To access the games there is a simple text menu with coloured words, and additionally you can check the list of Keypunch products. Space Attackers II requires a reboot both to enter and exit the game.
