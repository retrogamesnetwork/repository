description: Marble, the young and innocent apprentice of magic, has always been
  curious about one of her master's possessions, the magic "Wand of Wishes". One
  day the curious girl uses the wand; as a result, an evil demon is unleashed
  into the world. The spirit of the wand, a rabbit-like creature known as
  Sirius, tells Marble that it is now her responsibility to save the world from
  the demon, whose vile plan is to brainwash and sexually abuse ripe pretty
  young girls! Marble Cooking is an action game with puzzle-solving elements.
  The game consists of seven stages; each stage has one-screen levels. Marble is
  inserted into the level, with hostile creatures of various kinds (ghosts,
  books, demons, gangsters, brooms, etc.) wandering around her; the girl dies if
  any of the creatures touches her. The only way to defeat the creatures is
  through summoning Sirius. First, it is necessary to place a line of carrots on
  the floor. At any time afterwards, the player can call Sirius by pressing a
  button; the rabbit will then re-trace the carrot line, stopping where it ends.
  The goal is to time all this in such a way that the hostile creatures will
  collide with the running rabbit, leading to their demise. The levels get more
  complex as the game progresses, with room layouts (corridors, angles, and so
  on) working against Marble, more aggressive creatures with hard-to-predict
  movement patterns, etc. Scenes with explicit sexual content (mostly involving
  various fetishes, torture, and other sexual deviations) appear between stages.
