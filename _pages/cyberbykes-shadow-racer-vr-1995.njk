description: Cyberbykes was one of the earliest 3d games to support VR glasses
  and graphic resolutions higher than the VGA standard. It also includes network
  play and an editor. You control a robotic bike remotely. Blow up the
  opposition with 15 different weapons while recovering government secrets in a
  trendy-for-its-time cyberpunk nightmare future setting. Actual gameplay
  involves open 3D combat similar to Stellar 7 and Arctic Fox.
