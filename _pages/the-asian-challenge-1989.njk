description: "The Asian Challenge is an educational game which aims to improve
  the understanding of the Asian culture and geography. It was developed to be
  used during geography class. The player takes the role of a special
  investigator of the Senate Foreign Aid Committee who is tasked to travel
  around Asia and collect information. Each time the player enters a new area,
  the text is divided into three parts: a short description of the country
  (including some historical and social information), optionally a list of items
  which the player can interact with and a list of available exits. Every
  country is only represented with a few screens. Besides not getting lost (the
  author recommends to use an atlas), the puzzles involve collecting items and
  using them in other places. The parser understands simple verb-noun
  constructions and a few single-letter abbreviations. At the end of the game,
  the player has to take a multiple-choice test which asks for information given
  during play."
