description: Espionage is based on the board game of the same name. Up to four
  players (either human or computer-controlled) compete to become Master Spy by
  returning all the micro film canisters back to their base. A player has 12
  agents in their team including secret agents, surveillance agents and courier
  agents. Each type of agent moves around the board in a different way, not
  unlike in chess. Besides getting the micro film, another objective is to
  terminate any enemy agents. This is done as in draughts, by jumping over the
  agent into a free space. Killing enemy agents nets points, which, combined
  with points for recovered film canisters and surviving agents are tallied for
  the final score. The board is viewed from above. It does not fit the screen
  all at once, so scrolling is necessary. The game offers a hint function
  (indicating what the computer thinks is the best move to take) as well as the
  option to show the last move made. The game ends through an (optional and
  adjustable) time limit or when all film canisters have been retrieved.
