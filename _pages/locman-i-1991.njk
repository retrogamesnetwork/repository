description: Locman I is an arcade game, which applies an idea used in
  Perestroika to an underwater adventure. The player is put in the flippers of
  the scuba diver on his hunt for the treasure of Atlantis after the deployment
  from a submarine. The goal of the game is to pass through all the underwater
  labyrinths, caves, wrecked ships and the ruins of ancient Atlantis, and to
  finally reach the magical island with a castle, where the new perils and
  adventures await. On each fixed-screen level, the player directly controls the
  scuba diver, who should move between adjacent vertices of the path towards his
  goal. These vertices represent various objects, such as air bubbles,
  starfishes, fishes, shells, crabs, bottles, etc., which gradually grow smaller
  and eventually disappear, and new items appear to replace them. The player
  should not be in the place, when no such an item under him. But in case if it
  is happened, a one of additional air tanks becomes to be exhausted until the
  air is absent.  Certain underwater predators may either chase the scuba diver
  or wait in the hiding place to attack unexpectedly. Air tanks and precious
  pearls can be collected on the levels to increase the score. Transition
  between the levels is possible, when the transition vertex is found on the
  current level, it is one of vertices adjacent to the screen border. Levels can
  have several such vertices. Certain important items such as underwater gun,
  key, or fuel for the boat should be found to advance in the game. Obtaining
  the gun, the scuba diver can shoot his enemies, but they will quickly
  re-spawn. Highest scores are stored in top twelve table.
