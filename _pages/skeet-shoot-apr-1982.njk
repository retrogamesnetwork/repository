description: "A simple target-shooting game: you're armed with a swiveling gun
  on the ground, while targets streak across the sky from left to right (the
  title may lead you to expect \"clay pigeons\", but they look like actual birds
  -- at least as far as ASCII would allow).  The gun can be pointed in five
  different angles, and to get a good shot you'll have to aim carefully and lead
  the target.  You get exactly one minute to score as many accurate hits as you
  can."
