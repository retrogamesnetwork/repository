description: Clyde's Revenge (revenge for what, we are uncertain) is a sequel to
  Clyde's Adventure. It is a platform game that has you locked in many strange
  castles, and your only method of escape is to collect the magic stones to free
  yourself. Unlike many platform games, Clyde's Revenge has no enemies to kill
  and no bosses to beat. Instead, you must solve puzzles, avoid traps, and pull
  an innumerable number of levers. You will also need to collect life, in case
  of the odd tumble from a large height or the most unfortunate slip into a pool
  of lava.
