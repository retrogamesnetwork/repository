description: "Roadwar 2000 is a post-apocalyptic strategy game. In the year
  2000, bacteriological warfare has nearly destroyed civilization. Crime
  flourished, and highways turned into battlegrounds between different gangs.
  The protagonist is a leader of one of these gangs. More patriotically inclined
  than other criminal lords, he accepts a mission from the FBI: locate eight
  scientists who might be able to develop a vaccine against the deadly disease.
  The player commands the gang in tactical combat against rival gangs, mutants,
  and cannibals. It is possible to assign player-controlled characters to
  vehicles and move them on the battlefield. Combatants can use firearms and
  crossbows, as well as use the vehicles to ram each other. Boarding the
  opponents' vehicles is also possible."
