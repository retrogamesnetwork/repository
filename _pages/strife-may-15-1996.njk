description: "In the distant future, the Earth is ruled by a group of people who
  call themselves \"The Order\". Many disasters have plagued the planet, and
  after many wars, misery, and death, the Order controls people's lives and
  deprives them of their freedom. A rebel organization has been formed, seeking
  to overthrow the Order and whoever else might be behind their rise to power.
  Somewhere in the depths of a ruined Town Hall, a group of people who oppose
  the Order's regime welcome a lone wanderer to become the one who will free the
  Earth from terror. Strife is a plot-driven first-person shooter that uses the
  Doom engine. Rather than taking the player through a linear series of levels,
  the game offers a continuous world with free-roaming elements and a central
  \"hub\" (the town), which the player can visit between missions and explore.
  Although there are no true role-playing elements in the game, it has several
  features rarely seen in contemporary FPSs: there are \"friendly\" areas where
  there are no enemies but people to talk to, stores where new equipment can be
  bought, and taverns where the latest gossip is told. The player can also
  purchase upgrades that permanently increase the player character's health bar.
  The game has a branching storyline with a few paths that lead to three
  different endings. These paths are determined by a decision the player makes
  during the course of the plot."
