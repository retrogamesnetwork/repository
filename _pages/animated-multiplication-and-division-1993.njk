  Animated Multiplication and Division is a shareware educational title that
  aims to teach mental arithmetic to American school children in first, second
  and third grades The pupil chooses between either multiplication questions or
  division questions and selects the presentation style that suits them best.
  They then choose to answer questions either based on a specific number in the
  range 1-10 or a mixture of these numbers.

  Once the configuration questions have been answered the game asks a series of questions in the form 8 x ? = 16, or 16 ÷ ? = 2, leaving the player to enter the appropriate number. When all questions have been answered the player is rewarded with a mini game.
