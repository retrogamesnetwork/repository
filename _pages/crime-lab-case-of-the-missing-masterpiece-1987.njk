description: "Crime Lab: Case Of The Missing Masterpiece is a very short,
  shareware, educational single player game focused on the forensic procedure of
  blood typing. The Acme Art Gallery was burgled on April 1st, 1988 and the
  thief made off with a valuable painting, hence the title. As a crime lab
  technician the player's job is to analyse a blood sample. After quite a few
  detailed screens explaining the principles of the science behind this process
  the player prepares two reference samples and a sample taken from the crime
  scene. Based on the results of their analysis they then choose from a suspect
  list whose blood types are known. The game is keyboard controlled, has no
  sound and can be replayed because the culprit changes."
