description: Puzza is a simple 5x5 jigsaw puzzle game with a time limit. The
  player reveals a random piece of the puzzle on an empty field. Using the arrow
  keys an item can be moved to another space. The player can remove any item
  from the field, but it costs some time. Sometimes bonus items appear like an
  alarm clock or a coin that add time or points.
