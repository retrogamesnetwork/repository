description: Dots is a shareware strategy game similar to Reversi. Players start
  with counters on the corners of a 7x7 grid. The players have counters of
  different colours. Each player can move any piece of their colour to any other
  unoccupied cell in one of two ways. Moving a piece to any adjacent square
  causes the piece will be duplicated, resulting in the player owning two
  pieces, whereas moving two squares away just causes the piece to be moved.
  Players can capture another player's piece by moving one of their pieces to
  one of the eight squares surrounding the other player's piece.  The player
  with the most pieces on the board at the end of the game is the winner. The
  game is mouse controlled.
