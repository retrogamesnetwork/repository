description: "In a futuristic vision of the 21th century, mankind's most
  demanding and dangerous tasks are carried out by modular, adaptable robots
  called Hexsiders.  But dependence has its pitfalls: a rebelling faction of
  robots has taken down the defense command center by sabotaging its main
  computer - deactivating every robot within, but keeping all the automatic
  security systems engaged.  Outside the compound, only a small detachment of
  six Hexsiders remains.  They must infiltrate the heart of the structure under
  radio control and repair the defective computer. Control can be freely
  transferred from robot to robot.  The robots are far from humanoid - each
  Hexsider is a stack of hexagonal modules (up to 6), which can be added,
  removed or rearranged as needed.  These modules determine the robot's
  functionality: the Central Unit module contains the robot's power source and
  data storage; a rollers module (placed at the bottom) allows for movement;
  other module types can be used to interface with other robots, or access the
  building's security network.  New types will be found throughout the game, but
  your most precious module - the replacement unit for the main computer - is
  unique and irreplaceable. The maze-like environment is represented on a
  top-down hex grid map, though a rotating isometric 3D view can be used at any
  time.  Doors and teleports are level-restricted: each robot has a level
  (starting at 1), which can be raised by interfacing with higher-level robots
  you encounter.  A robot's level also restricts its access to the internal
  security network, which can be used to disable (or enable) lasers, mines and
  electro-magnets - strategically-placed defense systems that impede your
  progress and create intricate puzzles to be solved."
