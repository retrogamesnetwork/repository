description: "YAB! Baseball is a German-made baseball game with a rather simple
  gameplay, reminiscent of older, arcade-oriented approach to baseball
  simulations, such as RealSports Baseball. The player is able to control two
  real MLB (Major League Baseball) teams: the Boston Red Sox and the Toronto
  Blue Jets, represented by the corresponding colors."
