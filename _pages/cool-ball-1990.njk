description: "Pop-Up is a basic action game in which the player takes control
  over a bouncing ball. The goal of each one-screen level (the background themes
  progress from the big bang all the way to the future) is simple: bouncing
  between platforms, collecting as many points as possible and above all the
  exit key which opens up the way to the next level. Of course there are various
  hazards to overcome, mostly in the form of special platforms like sticky or
  angled ones. There are also other tools to collect which can be used to make
  life easier at other places: water drops for extinguishing fires, a hammer for
  destroying walls and keys for opening up passages."
