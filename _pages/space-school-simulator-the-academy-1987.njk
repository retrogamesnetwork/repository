  takes things away from the Tau Ceti setting. Players take the role of a
  student at an academy for advanced piloting. There they need to solve 20
  simulated missions on a wide range of planets. The self-contained missions
  mean that the game uses the Tau Ceti structure and theme, without the
  causality of previous decisions having an effect on later choices. This
  reduces the complexity of management. Although players can customize the
  ships, including giving them names of your choice, the game comes with
  supplied ones include a variety that should suit many different circumstances.
  Whichever vehicle is chosen, players will control it from a 1st person
  perspective and a series of controls. All ships skim over the surface of the
  planet and feature weapons. Most missions will involve destroying rogue robots
  enemies. Players will have to dock with buildings to refuel or move on to a
  different planet.
