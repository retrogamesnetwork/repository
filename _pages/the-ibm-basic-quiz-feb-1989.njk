description: This follow-up to The Computer Quiz features the same engine, but
  its hundred questions deal with the BASIC programming language.  As before,
  the player is given three "men," and loses a man every time a question is
  answered incorrectly. Bonus men can be earned by answering ten questions
  correctly. At the end of play, men are cashed in for points, meaning that the
  best possible score is 113.
