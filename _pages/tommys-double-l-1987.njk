description: Tommy's Double L is a shareware, single-player, puzzle / strategy
  game for one player vs the computer. This game is based on a puzzle devised by
  Edward De Bono in his book "The Five Day Course In Thinking". It is a puzzle /
  strategy game which is played on a 4x4 grid. Each player has an 'L' shaped
  piece that is 3 cells long and 2 cells wide and there are also two Jammers
  which occupy a single cell. Players take turns and in each turn they must move
  their piece and optionally one or both jammers. The game ends when a player
  cannot move when their turn comes around. The game is entirely keyboard
  controlled. It has basic sound effects and command line switches to start the
  game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display
