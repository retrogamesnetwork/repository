description: In the future, races are held across America where the drivers race
  for money, and their lives. You are the rookie. Welcome to Deathtrack.
  Starting off the game with a meager sum, you can choose from three cars
  (either speedy, plenty of firepower or heavily-armored) and begin practicing
  for your races against the other drivers. Your opponents have all been
  captured in 16-colour digital photo splendour. Featuring 3D polygonal cars
  racing against each other, they try their best to remove you from the race,
  permanently. Your winnings can be used to upgrade your car's armor, weapons
  and parts to make your car impervious to harm, a juggernaut of firepower,
  hurtling down the 10 available tracks.
