description: The Battle on the Black Sea is an adaptation of the Battleship
  board game, representing a fictional conflict between Russian Federation and
  Ukraine for the domination over the Black Sea after the U.S.S.R. collapse.
  Rather a parody of the collapse situation, the game puts the player in the
  shoes of the Russian fleet commander on his campaign to conquer the Ukrainian
  ports.
