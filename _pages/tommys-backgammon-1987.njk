description: Tommy's Backgammon is a single-player shareware game. As with most
  of Tommy's games it uses character graphics and is entirely keyboard
  controlled. It has basic sound effects and command line switches to start the
  game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome display.
  This game has nine skill levels, and a choice of Dutch or Standard backgammon
  (in Dutch backgammon all the pieces start on the Bar). It allows a player to
  pass their turn and has options for Dares and Take-Back's. All the stations
  are numbered, the white tokens move clockwise around the board from
  station  one to twenty-four, the black/red tokens move in the opposite
  direction from station twenty-four to one. Moves are made by entering the
  start and end positions for example 17-22 to move a white token five spaces or
  17-12 to move a black token five spaces. The game also accepts 17+22 or 17+12
  and 17 'SPACE' 22 or 17'SPACE'12 for the same moves. 'B' is used when a token
  is moved off the BAR and 'O' is used to move a token off the board or
  alternatively white can also move to position twenty-five and black can move
  to zero.
