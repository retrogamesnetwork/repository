description: A traffic control simulation in which the player must manage the
  flow of vehicles throughout a busy city block, during the rush hours of
  7:00-9:00 AM. Every car has a particular destination, and as the clock ticks,
  traffic density increases and the streets jam up.  Score is determined by the
  number of waiting cars during each game minute (the lower, the better). Each
  traffic light may be toggled individually or using an automated control
  system. After 7:40, all unlit lights come on automatically; at 8:00 the
  automated system fails - the lights must be controlled manually, and cannot be
  turned off until 8:46.  The simulation ends at 9:00, and success is determined
  by the number of waiting (and total) cars at that point; if too many cars line
  up at any of the entry points during the game, the player loses. It is
  possible to redirect traffic between the entry points to clear up particularly
  heavy jams. A tow truck can be used to remove individual cars and resolve
  gridlocks (at the cost of a score penalty).
