description: Pumpkins from all over the planet stole Earth's candles to their
  home planet. Now, as an axe yielding maniac, you must destroy them and collect
  the candles back. This is a simple 2D action game where you must travel
  through mazes, kill pumpkins and collect candles. Its fame  comes from a
  newsgroup running joke about a (at the time non-existing) game that would be a
  Doom killer, but could not generate enough hype due to its horrible sounding
  name. Reportedly, the developers wrote it in 48 hours to capitalize on the
  joke.
