description: One of the few political sims available, take over the Kremlin as
  one of the three Russian leaders (Ligachov, Yeltsin, or Gorbachov), determine
  your foreign and domestic policies, and react to the crises that happens (like
  the Chernobyl crisis). Keep yourself in office by keeping both the
  Nationalists and the Reformists in line. Can you do better than Gorbachov
  himself?
