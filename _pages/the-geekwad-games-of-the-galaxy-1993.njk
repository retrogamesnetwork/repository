description: "In Geekwad: Games of the Galaxy the player takes control of the
  Geekwad Gamer, the best gamer in the universe. To win the game one has to free
  a king by getting the high score at five video games and trivia. All the games
  are parodies of classic arcade games like Spaced Solicitors ( Space Invaders),
  Beefender ( Defender), Phlegming (the name is like Lemmings but gameplay is
  closer to Joust), Grogger ( Frogger), and more."
