description: Battle Cheese has a Risk-Like interface which features a "cheese"
  theme. The rules however are significantly different than Risk. You gain
  points from holding territories and with these points buy units. These
  different types of units each have their own strengths and weaknesses and are
  different types of cheese. The goal of Battle Cheese is to take all of the
  territories (in the shareware version, Europe or North America; registered,
  maps become available for play in Asia and Australia also) with your units.
