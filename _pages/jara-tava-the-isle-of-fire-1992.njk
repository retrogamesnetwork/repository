description: "Jara-Tava: The Isle of Fire is a traditionally-styled graphical
  text adventure.  Your recently deceased uncle has bequeathed you a map
  purporting to show the location of Captain Kidd's treasure, sending you on a
  quest to explore the remote South Pacific islands of Jara-Mau and
  Jara-Tava.  Can you survive the shark-infested waters and an imminent volcanic
  eruption to make off with the fabled treasure? As in most parser-driven games,
  actions are achieved by typing simple commands: \"Inventory,\" \"South,\"
  \"Get sword,\" \"Tie rope,\" etc.  A static first-person view illustrates the
  current scene, and the player can examine the map in their inventory to see
  the overall layout of the island.  The Amiga port adds the ability to access
  some of the most common commands (such as movement, inventory, and the map
  view) by clicking with the mouse.  Despite the game's short length, there are
  multiple distinct solutions to the challenges encountered: the manual states
  there are four ways to travel between the islands and three ways to find the
  treasure."
