description: "The Kingdom of Syree is a RPG based on the novels by Lord Steven
  and heavily inspired by the earlier Ultima games. After many years of peace
  evil is threatening the kingdom of Syree: an evil wizard wishes to conquer the
  kingdom. None of the kingdom's great heroes have returned from their search
  for the wizard, and now it is your time to search for him and kill him. The
  screen is divided into three parts. To the upper left is the game area where
  all the action takes place. To the upper right is the status area where you
  can see your equipment, health and wealth, and at the bottom of the screen is
  the message window where conversations and such will show up. The game
  features lots of exploring and monster killing."
