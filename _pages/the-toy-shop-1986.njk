description: "Here's an unusual one: The Toy Shop is a set of computerized
  patterns for building your own mechanical models.  You use the software to
  print out the pieces, then assemble them according to a set of instructions
  that come with the software.  There are 20 different models, including trucks
  and cars with wheels that turn, a crane, an oil pump, a balloon-powered
  locomotive, a penny-powered clockwork bank, a helicopter powered by a rubber
  band, a sundial, a carousel, and the Spirit of St. Louis airplane with a
  working propeller.  Designs can be printed on regular computer paper, then
  glued to card stock, cut out, and assembled."
