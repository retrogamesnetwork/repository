description: Mirage Thunder is a top-down vertical scrolling shooter in which
  player controls a spaceship that flies through complex formations of emerging
  enemies in space. There is a wide array of weapons and power-ups available,
  including various guns, lasers, energy blasts, missiles, and satellite drones
  that aid shooting and can be rotated manually around the plane as player wants
  them to. Enemies try to both crash into player's spaceship or shoot various
  missiles to deal the damage. Successful kill of a wave of enemies typically
  yields a power-up. There are usually several huge boss enemies in each stage.
  The game shares the same engine with the developer's previous vertical shooter
  Dawn Raider.
