  ugc">city-building</a> <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_and_management_simulation_games"
  rel="noopener nofollow ugc">simulation</a> video game developed by <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Wright_(game_designer)" rel="noopener
  nofollow ugc">Will Wright</a> and released for a number of platforms from 1989
  to 1991. <em>SimCity</em> features two-dimensional graphics and an overhead
  perspective. The objective of the game is to create a city, develop
  residential and industrial areas, build infrastructure and collect taxes for
  further development of the city. Importance is put on increasing the standard
  of living of the population, maintaining a balance between the different
  sectors, and monitoring the region’s environmental situation to prevent the
  settlement from declining and going bankrupt.</p>

  <p><em>SimCity</em> was independently developed by Will Wright beginning in 1985, and would not see its first release until 1989.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_(1989_video_game)#cite_note-medium.com-2" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">[2]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_(1989_video_game)#cite_note-3" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">[3]</a> Because the game lacked any of the arcade or action elements that dominated the video game market in the 1980s, video game publishers declined to release the title in fear of its commercial failure, until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broderbund" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Broderbund</a> eventually agreed to distribute it. Although the game initially sold poorly, positive feedback from the gaming press boosted its sales. After becoming a best-seller, <em>SimCity</em> was released on several other platforms, most notably on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Super NES</a> in 1991, in which its gameplay was significantly improved with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nintendo</a>’s involvement.</p>

  <p><em>SimCity</em> was commercially successful, selling 300,000 units for personal computers and nearly 2 million units for the SNES. The game was recognized as a new phenomenon within the gaming industry, and it broke the widespread belief that computer games were primarily intended for children. <em>SimCity</em> was met with critical appraisal for its innovative and addictive gameplay in spite of the absence of platformer or shooter elements. Reviewers considered the game to be instructive and helpful toward the player’s understanding of the basics of urban planning, politics and economics. <em>SimCity</em> received numerous awards from various news publishers and associations. The success of <em>SimCity</em> marked the beginning of the urban simulation genre of video games, as well as publisher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxis" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Maxis</a>’s tradition of producing non-linear simulation games, one of which – <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims_(video_game)" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">The Sims</a></em> – would surpass all its predecessors in popularity and become one of the best-selling franchises in the video game industry. It is considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_games_considered_the_best" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">one of the greatest video games of all time.</a></p>
