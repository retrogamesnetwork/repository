description: "Commander Keen has already foiled the Vorticons' plans to destroy
  Earth. Now he heads to their home planet in order to confront the Grand
  Intellect: a mysterious leader who enslaved all the Vorticons and forced them
  to carry out his evil deeds. But before Keen reaches him, he must get through
  numerous Vorticon cities whose mind-controlled residents all received one
  order from the Grand Intellect: \"Keen must die!\" Commander Keen 3: Keen Must
  Die! is the third in a series of platform games. The game begins with a
  top-down map of the Vorticon planet. This is the level select screen, where
  you can walk around and choose the next level you want to enter. On each
  level, you have to make your way to the exit. Once you reach the exit, you're
  back on the overhead map. The levels are typically full of enemy creatures
  (mainly various types of Vorticons) and hazards. If Keen gets shot or touched
  by an enemy, or falls into a pit or something hazardous, he dies, and you're
  booted out of the level back to the overhead map and lose one life.
  Thankfully, Keen can defeat most enemies with his raygun. He also has a pogo
  stick which allows him to jump very high. Other items to find include keycards
  that open locked doors, bonus items which give score (Keen gets an extra life
  if he collects enough score) and the Ankh, which gives temporary
  invulnerability."
