description: Atomic Tetris is a two player Tetris game, it is not meant to be
  played by one player vs the computer. The game is played side by side with
  both players sharing the keyboard. It is basically plays the same as standard
  Tetris, blocks fall, lines across the screen must be completed to score points
  etc. There is, however a twist in that there are power bricks, called Specials
  within the game, which, when included in a completed line, can cause the
  opponent problems. There are thirteen Specials in the game and their effects
  range from clearing the screen, switching the screens over, randomising the
  opponents screen to changing all the opponents bricks into small dots making
  them hard to see.
