  Drops of Light is a single player puzzle game that's played on a star shaped
  web On the web are what look like coloured beads, these are photons and the
  puzzle is to move, arrange and combine the photons to produce a specific
  pattern of colours. The game is postcard-ware, i.e. It is freeware but the
  developer would like a postcard so that they know their game is being played
  and how far it has travelled. Each level gives the user a password which
  allows them to restart the game without replaying all the earlier levels, the
  passwords were available on-line too. Expansion levels were included with each
  version of the software, they were also available on-line, version 2.0.3 was
  supplied with the following;

  drops2.dlv    -- "Dropping Down Further" expansion  levels (med - hard difficulty)
