description: Mortal Pong is a one or two player game that can be played either
  by two players on the same machine or over a modem via XBAND PC. The game is
  based on Pong. Balls are launched from the centre of the screen and the
  players use paddles to keep the ball in play. The longer the game goes on the
  more balls appear. If a player lets a ball go past them then they lose health,
  (the developer says this is similar to a player losing health in the Mortal
  Kombat games - hence the name), and once a player has lost all health the game
  is over
