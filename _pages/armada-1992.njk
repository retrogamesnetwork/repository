description: "Armada is a Battleship variant. With all options deselected, it
  offers the standard experience: Each the player and the opponent (either
  another human or the computer)  have a 10x10 grid on which they divide five
  ships of different sizes. Then they take turns and select one of the other's
  grids to take a shot. The goal is to destroy all enemy ships first. The
  available special options are stealth fighters (each side has a combat plane
  which automatically take additional shots on the other grid), scopes (allows
  to scout the enemy grids, but adds a time limit of 60 seconds), mines (kill
  everything within their blast radius of 2 grids when hit) and day/night. When
  all or one of those options are used, the abilities of the ships come into
  play: the carrier (five grids) is responsible for keeping the stealth fighter
  in play and the destroyers (four grids) hold the equipment for keeping the
  jammers (2 grids) useful which hurt the enemy's scope. There are also three
  different AI opponents with different scope training and one of them instantly
  knows the mine coordinates."
