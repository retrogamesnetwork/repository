description: "Solid State Pinball: Tristan is a pinball simulator which features
  a single medieval-themed board (hence the title) displayed in a single screen
  with score and bonus indicators filling the rest of the screen. Includes
  multiplayer hot-seat support in which each player plays a ball and switches
  when losing and also features the ability to nudge and tilt the machine,
  besides regular paddle controls."
