description: This edutainment title takes on the familiar interactive
  fiction/adventure format, with a text parser-driven interface similar to other
  Topologika releases, and adds a twist in the form of mathematical/logic
  puzzles used to drive the story.  Aimed at the ages of 10 and above, the game
  takes its basic plot from the folk tale of Jack and the Beanstalk.  You take
  on the role of Jack (if a boy) or Jackie (if a girl), sent to the market with
  explicit orders from Mum to buy a pig. If you play your cards right, you can
  obtain a magic bean, plant it, and ascend the resulting beanstalk for yet more
  adventures and conundrums.  The numerous brain-teasers include numerical
  puzzles, exercises in spatial orientation, geometric pattern recognition and
  map navigation; several are randomized and require a fresh solution each time
  you play.  There are points to be earned and treasures to find - hopefully
  worth somewhat more than the porker you were sent out to get.
