description: "TIE Invaders is a simple, fixed-screen space shooter. The player
  takes control of a dinky, mobile cannon that can move left and right across
  the bottom of the screen. This unlikely defender finds itself harassed by a
  never-ending wave of alien intruders hell-bent on ruining everybody's day;
  these TIE fighters from space come in two main variants: smaller ones drop
  simple missiles straight down at the player, while their larger brothers
  prefer to fire three-way spread shots.  There are no levels, just continuous
  action - more invaders arrive regularly to replace their fallen comrades. The
  player's gunner can fire continuously, and its weapon can be gradually
  improved by collecting power-ups.  There are three lives to start with, plus a
  new one for every 1000 points.  The game runs entirely in (80x50) text mode,
  although in demoscene tradition it's tweaked for special effects like screen
  fades and scrolling starfields."
