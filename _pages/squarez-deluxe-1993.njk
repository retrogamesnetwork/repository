description: "Squarez is a puzzle game with similarities to Tetris.  Various
  shapes consisting of one to eight tiles appear in a 3x3 area and must be
  placed on the playing field within ten seconds.  When a 3x3 or larger square
  is created it disappears.  The game is over once a part of a shape remains in
  the area where it appears after its ten seconds are up. There are three game
  modes: Basic, Normal, and Extreme. The Normal mode is just like Basic except
  that some of the shapes contain special tiles.  These tiles are activated when
  the square containing them disappears.  Some tiles, like bombs and score
  multipliers, are helpful, while others, like spikes, should be left alone.  In
  the Extreme mode there are a lot more of these special tiles. Squarez also
  features a head to head mode.  In this mode two players each have their own
  playing field, and certain special tiles activated by one player can affect
  the other.  The player to last the longest wins."
