  In Club & Country the player is the coach of a English soccer team and is in
  charge of the athletic and financial success. He starts in the Third Division
  and eventually becomes the English national coach.

  On the financial side he can buy and sell players, expand the stadium and fire or hire other staff like a groundskeeper. On the athletic side the main aspects are the training and the large tactical possibilities which can be set for every player. The matches are displayed in a screen where the lineup of the player's and the enemy's team is given. There is no animation but there is a text commentary on the bottom of the screen. The player is able to make tactical changes during the game and substitute players. When a special event happens, e.g. a goal, a still in comic graphics is displayed.
