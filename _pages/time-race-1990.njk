description: The game is a strategical puzzle action, where you have to
  eliminate the playfield filling it with the tiles of different colors until
  the time will be exhausted. Each playfield represents a certain period of the
  human evolution such as Prehistory, Crusades, Prohibition or Berlin Wall. On
  each level some animation takes place, and you should perform your goal until
  it logically finishes. The tiles are triangles of different colors, sometimes
  combined in groups, appear in one corner of the playfield and should be put in
  another place based on the player's strategy in the way to do not block the
  path for other tiles. When four triangle tiles with adjacent tiles of
  different colors formed a square, this square will be eliminated from
  playfield with its part and no tiles may be placed or moved here. Adjacent
  tiles of the same colors will be eliminated from playfield, but playfield will
  remain untouched. Tiles may be moved on the playfield and rotated over the
  center of the square. Also playfield may include different obstacles, which
  may influence on moving/rotation of your tiles to make it more difficult, and
  they should be avoided in any possible way. Finishing the level will give you
  the code, which may be used later to access this level. There are 30 levels
  available to play.
