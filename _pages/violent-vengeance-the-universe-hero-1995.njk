description: "This one-on-one fighting game pits ten contestants against one
  another in classic tournament style, all vying for the truly lofty title of
  'Universe Hero'.  This grandiosity is not without explanation: it‚Äôs the end of
  the 21st century, and the galaxy is just settling down after a long series of
  bloody interstellar wars.  The powers-that-be attempt to secure peace by
  finding another outlet for all that pent-up bloodthirst and putting those
  violent impulses to better use.  As a formal, ritual replacement for war, an
  annual fighting tournament is announced - allowing the most capable warriors
  from every known planet to challenge one another for the ultimate honor.
  Despite the futuristic setting and cosmic scale, the combatants are all
  generally humanoid, although their fighting styles and move repertoires are
  appropriately varied; some are more exotic in form, while others appear
  decidedly human.  In keeping with genre conventions, the fighters all have
  their more mundane chops as well as special moves (using ranged attacks, melee
  weapons, and other less conventional means), all executed using directional
  controls plus kick and punch buttons.  Besides the single-player tournament
  mode, which culminates in the customary boss battles, two players can battle
  each other - either on the same machine or via modem."
