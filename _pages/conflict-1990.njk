description: Conflict is a political/strategy simulator, inspired by a
  prediction of how events in the Middle East could unfold in the 1990s. In this
  1997, the Israeli prime minister dies (either by assassination or by bomb
  blast), and you're appointed as the new prime minister. In the game you have
  to make and follow political policies regarding other countries in the Middle
  East, control intelligence and purchase arms, try to beat the other countries
  in the nuclear race and keep peace with the Palestinians and, of course,
  conduct battles with other countries.
