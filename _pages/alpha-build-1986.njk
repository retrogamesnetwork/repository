description: Alpha Build is an educational game that teaches alphabet skills to
  children. The player controls a penguin called Perry who has to climb ladders
  to pick up letters and then drop them onto the correct truck. The aim of the
  game is to build a city and to do so three sets of trucks have to be loaded
  with letters. Each stage involves loading eight trucks which will then drive
  away and construct the city. First the frame is built, then the surface and
  finally it is coloured. There are eight levels of play. The first four levels
  involve simple letter recognition, upper and lower case matching and
  alphabetical order. Level 5 adds words to the game while level 6 to 8 are word
  challenges in which some of the needed letters are hidden.
