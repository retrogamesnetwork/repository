description: "Mysterious disasters have begun the once thriving fantasy land.
  Natural disasters and diseases trouble the population. A group of villagers
  was sent to seek the assistance of the reclusive wizard Astrix - but it has
  never returned. A new group is sent, led by the young carpenter Bergon, who is
  accompanied by the wizard Praxix, the healer Esher, and the true protagonist
  of the game - a merchant named Tag. Despite its \"RPG-like\" premise and the
  player's control of a party of four characters with unique powers, Journey:
  The Quest Begins is a puzzle-solving adventure game without role-playing
  elements. Unlike most Infocom games of the time, no typing is required in this
  game; the interface provides the player with a multiple choice of actions that
  the player selects in order to make the story progress. The game has plenty of
  text and detailed interaction possibilities. Using the abilities of the four
  controlled characters is often required to solve the puzzles."
