  Defense is a game of American football that can be played by two or four
  players, or by one player vs the computer. It was released as shareware. The
  game's documentation says that it aims to be realistic as opposed to pretty
  with the player controlling the disposition of players, the plays and making
  the tackles. There are also options for defensive and offensive formations
  which can be player selected or the computer can choose between them
  automatically. Defense is always played left to right across the screen with
  the computer's team always being on the left. The game can be controlled via
  keyboard, mouse, joystick(s) and combinations of these devices depending on
  the number of people playing. The field of play is viewed top-down and is
  divided into zones, such as the rush zone, the line zone, the linebacker zone
  and the safety zone, into which players are placed. As a ball carrier attempts
  to run the length of the field they pass through these zones and the player
  instructs their player(s) to tackle / stop them via designated HIT keys. 
       
  There is a comprehensive instruction document in Word format that accompanies the game. It deals with game tactics such as rushing, defensive signal calling, moving players, blocking and more.
