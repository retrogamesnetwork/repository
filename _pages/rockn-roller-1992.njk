description: "Rock'N Roller is a game similar to the game Rally X, in Rock'N
  Roller the player takes control of a buggy, that must find, in each of the 30
  stages, the six parts of a prototype car, that are hidden in the stages. In
  each stage there are three enemy types: speed cars, armed jeeps, and a giant
  helicopter equipped with missiles. Additionally there are varied traps (like
  dangerous bridges, oil spots, mines, red semaphores, etc.) that must be
  avoided and a limited amount of fuel that must be taken into consideration."
