description: Karn the warrior has been the scourge of a group of evil wizards
  for many years, and as such they have trapped a demon inside the Deathbringer
  Sword. Karn has this sword, and must use it to get through 30 levels to wreak
  his revenge. The game is side-scrolling and beat 'em up focused. The levels
  are inter-connected and have multiple exits available, with over 600 screens
  in total. The publishers made a big deal of the level of parallax scrolling
  and other graphical detail in the game.
