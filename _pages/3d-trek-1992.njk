description: 3D Trek is a single-player adventure game based, unofficially, on
  Star Trek, the original series. The game was developed using Domark's Virtual
  Reality Studio and it's a timed adventure game which, given the similarity of
  the corridors plays like a maze exploration game. The self destruct sequence
  on the USS Enterprise has been triggered and the player must explore the ship
  and some off-ship areas to find five coloured objects plus a few tools, take
  them to the Engineering section, access the computer terminal there and
  prevent the detonation. All of this must be accomplished before the timer runs
  out. The game can be played by the mouse, keyboard, or joystick and it has
  some basic sound effects such as 'Bong' when the player walks into a wall or a
  'Whoosh' when an action is triggered. It can be played in English, French,
  German or Italian.
