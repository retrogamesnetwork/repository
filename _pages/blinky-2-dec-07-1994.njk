description: "Blinky the purple dinosaur returns to action, as the evil
  Shnookwad -- thwarted but not defeated by their previous encounter --
  unleashes an army of monsters upon Funky Forest. With his Box of Everlasting
  Doughnuts to hand and his faithful cat (named, er, Doughnut) behind him,
  Blinky explores sixteen colorful levels and fights four complex bosses to
  restore peace to his sylvan domain -- at least, for a little while. In Blinky
  2, Jeremy LaMar heavily draws on 3/4 perspective top-down material like The
  Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past to map out a broadly linear
  action-adventure game, with simulated height and depth to augment the 2D
  environment. Each level is large and complex, often involving a journey from
  one location through another, winding transitional space, into a third
  location -- which in turn often serves as a transition to the next map. The
  player will journey through forests, swamps, waterfalls, dungeons, and even
  snake mazes -- each with its own environmental dangers and challenges, from
  poisonous spores to conveyor belts to huge, multi-segmented serpents."
