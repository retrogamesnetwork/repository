description: "Take command of one of seven German U-Boats during WWII and hunt
  down and destroy allied convoys. This is never an easy task since their
  escorts and aircraft are waiting to ruin your day. The level of realism, and
  with it the difficulty, can be set by enabling or disabling ten options, e.g.
  unlimited ammo, clear sight or even invulnerability. Campaigns can be started
  in one of several time slots, allowing you to play for the entire war if you
  wish. During these campaigns you gain medals and promotions which includes the
  command of better submarines. You can also choose to play a single mission
  where you can set certain variables, e.g. number of ships or weather
  conditions. Specific missions aren't required because the engine \"rolls up\"
  convoys and targets, meaning every time you play the missions will change. The
  type and location of these missions depend on the historical time and the used
  submarine. The submarine consists of several rooms where you can access the
  functions and instruments you'll need, e.g. the logbook in the captain's room
  or the fuel and battery prompt in the engine room. However, the most important
  functions can be brought up at any time, this includes the sea map where you
  set waypoints. The crew can take over certain tasks, e.g. identifying ships.
  The CD-ROM version adds additional multimedia features: video interviews with
  German submariners, an on-line manual gives detailed information about the
  historical background and submarine tactics as well as historical maps,
  movies, photos and articles."
