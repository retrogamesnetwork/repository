description: Osbit is a single-player, freeware, keyboard controlled, runny
  jumpy platform game. Osbit is an operating system bit who lives inside a
  computer. After a power surge struck the computer Osbit found himself a long
  way from home and must now fight his way, the power surge released nasty bugs,
  through the three levels of corrupted areas of DOS back to the A-prompt and
  home.
