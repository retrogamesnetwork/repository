description: Ack! Man is a single player, keyboard controlled, Pac Man game. In
  this game Ack! Man replaces Pac-Man and the four ghosts are Finky, Stinky,
  Dinky and Clyde. The gameplay is just the same, race around a maze eating
  pills and, when a power pill has been eaten, chasing and eating the ghosts.
  The game has fourteen levels and randomly occurring bonus items.
