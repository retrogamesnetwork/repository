description: As Fleet Admiral of a newly commissioned starship armada you send
  your ships from the home planet to explore the unknown resources of the stars.
  The planets circling those stars may be barren or they may have industrial
  capacity and will resist your colonization attempts. It is up to you whether
  to conquer and colonize those worlds, and convert them to producing new ships
  for continued expansion, and to bring the entire galaxy under your control.
  Galaxy can be played by as many as 20 players who compete against each other
  for control of up to 40 star systems. If you are playing multiplayer, the
  person controlling the most planets at game end is the winner. The computer
  produces a different galaxy every game.
