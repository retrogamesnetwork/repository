description: Bible Adventures contains three different side scrolling platform
  games, each with a different bible theme. The first game is Noah's Ark. Here
  the player needs to search forests, caverns, and mountains to find a male and
  female of each species and bring them back to the ark before the flood begins.
  The next game is Save Baby Moses, where the player needs to get past numerous
  soldiers and other obstacles to bring the baby Moses to safety. The last game
  is David and Goliath. As the shepherd David, the player needs to round up and
  protect the family's flock of sheep. After all of the sheep are safe, the
  player will then need to face Goliath. The game features scripture taken from
  the Holy Bible, New International Version to provide clues or information.
