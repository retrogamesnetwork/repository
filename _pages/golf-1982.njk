description: "This particular computer adaptation of golf is entirely
  text-based.  Each tee has a different length and par, and the player swings by
  choosing a type of club to use: the arsenal includes four woods (numbered 1
  through 4), eight irons (2 through 9) and a wedge for when you get closer to
  the hole.  Once you're on the green, you get to use a putter: the putt is
  controlled by a number from 1 (minimum distance, maximum accuracy) to 10 (the
  reverse). After each swing, you get an update with the results and your
  current distance to the hole.  Lose the ball entirely, and you'll have to
  replay with a two-stroke penalty.  After you play all nine holes, you can
  choose to play nine more - or quit and see your scores."
