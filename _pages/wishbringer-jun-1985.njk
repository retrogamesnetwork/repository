description: 'In this game, the player controls a postal clerk in the small
  fishing village of Festeron. The postmaster, Mr. Crisp, orders the player to
  deliver an envelope to the owner of Ye Olde Magick Shoppe. However, this
  seemingly innocent task inexplicably leads to a strange phenomenon: as the
  hero steps out, he finds that  Festeron has been mysteriously transformed into
  a dark, ominous town called Witchville. Even cute little poodles have turned
  into hellhounds! Finding the Wishbringer, a stone that grants seven wishes to
  those who possess the right objects, seems like the only solution - or is it?
  Wishbringer is a text adventure set in the Zork universe. The player types in
  commands to navigate the character, interact with the game world, and solve
  puzzles. The game has a rather open-ended structure, with many situations
  possessing several solutions; the player can opt for a "magical" approach to
  the tasks, using the titular stone, or attempt to solve the game in a more
  straightforward way.'
