description: Based on the famous Looney Tunes cartoon characters, the game is
  educational action for the kids. You are Daffy Duck, and this time you are a
  Private Investigator (P.I.). The letters are escaped from their words and
  scattered, where they want. You should find the missing letters and fill the
  words with proper ones to complete your job successfully and to collect a
  great amount of money for this not simple task. Completing different themed
  locations, Daffy will progress from one location to another. Each location
  represent a single screen, where letters are scattered in random places as
  well as different words located. You should collect the letter and bring it to
  proper word. When all words are filled the location will be passed, and Daffy
  will be allowed to proceed further. Also different enemies such as Elmer Fudd,
  Sylvester J. Pussycat, Yosemite Sam, or Wile E. Coyote are present on
  locations. They want to kill Daffy, but Daffy can also make them stunned with
  different weapons, such as bananas or eggs. Bonus levels are present between
  locations. Such levels are time-oriented and represents the matrix of the
  letters. You should mark the letters one by one to get a word. Each word will
  give you points. And each thousand of points will give you life, which you may
  loose on locations, therefore you should find as much words on bonus levels as
  possible. There are 3 difficulty levels and High Score table to store the most
  impressive results in the game.
