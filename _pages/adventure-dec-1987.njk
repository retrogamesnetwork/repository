description: Adventure is a port of the mainframe text adventure Adventure (also
  known as Colossal Cave Adventure). It is based on Bob Supnik 's DECUS
  implementation of Don Woods ' enhanced version with 350 points. During the
  game, the player visits and explores a cave. The goal is to find treasure by
  solving puzzles. Interactions with the game are conducted by entering
  verb-noun commands into the text parser. This version includes the option to
  set the displayed location description to either verbose and brief (normally
  the verbose version is only shown when entering a location for the first
  time), occasional offers to receive hints in exchange for points and the
  possibility to save.
