description: In these days where card games abound and compilations can contain
  hundreds of games it's easy to forget that it was not always so. Clock
  Solitaire is a single player, shareware game consisting of just one solitaire
  variant.  It is played entirely with the mouse, the player clicks on the pack
  to deal and then moves cards around to their corresponding position in a clock
  face arrangement. This form of solitaire is one where there is very little
  strategy, success ofrfailure depends entirely upon the deal of the cards.
