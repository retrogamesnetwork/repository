description: "In Torpedo Alley the player commands a submarine in hostile
  waters, with one objective: sink as many enemy ships as possible.  The sub is
  armed with a limited cache of torpedoes, and as enemy ships zig-zag across the
  periscope view, each launch must be timed accurately to intercept its
  target.  If a ship makes it halfway across the screen without being sunk, it
  spots the player's sub and starts shooting; any damage will destroy some of
  the remaining torpedoes. The only way to evade enemy fire is to dive
  deeper.  When the sub is fully underwater, the 1st-person periscope screen is
  replaced with a side view, where the player maneuvers to avoid depth charges
  placed by the enemy: a single charge means certain death if it hits.  When the
  sub is destroyed (or runs out of torpedoes) the game is over."
