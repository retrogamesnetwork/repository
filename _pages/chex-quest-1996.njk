description: Chex Quest is a 3D FPS running on a modified DOOM engine. The
  planet Bazoik has been overrun by Flemoids- mucous-like alien creatures who
  are consuming all of the IFC's (Intergalactic Federation of Cereals)
  nutritious foods.  You, a large square-shaped man must go in and rid the
  various levels of the miscellaneous green Flemoids. Your weaponry starts out
  with a bootspoon (which can be upgraded to a Super Bootspork) and a small
  Zorcher (which uses Zorch energy).  The Zorcher can, of course, be upgraded to
  frightening levels...  Zorch is apparently an interdimensional substance,
  because enough of it can "send a Flemoid back to his homeworld." You can strap
  on armor, of course- the armor is a Chex kibble (or a Super Chex
  kibble).  This will protect you from the mucous that the Flemoids snort at
  you. The opening contains a notice to concerned parents, avowing that the game
  is non-violent; to keep childrens' interest, the violence was replaced with
  (and they tried to be delicate here) gross booger sounds.  Your character
  never "dies", but becomes immobilized by being covered from head to toe in
  mucous. Healthy eating habits are also supposedly reinforced- health is
  regained by eating a bowl of fruit (10% energy), bowl of vegetables (25%), a
  glass of water (5%), or... yes... "a complete breakfast", featuring a bowl of
  cereal (presumably Chex), toast, glass of milk, and a piece of fruit, for a
  complete health boost.
