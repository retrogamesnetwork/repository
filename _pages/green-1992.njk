description: Green is an eco-strategy shareware game for one player. The game is
  based on a map which represents an idyllic rural area. The planners are out in
  force building pavements all over the landscape and the player must build
  walls and clear pathways in order to prevent them. Points are awarded for
  planners trapped / immobilised by walls and points are lost as the planners
  lay more pathways. The game is mouse controlled with function keys being used
  to access the in-game help and to quit.
