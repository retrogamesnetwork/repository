description: Bedlam is a vertically scrolling space shoot‚Äôem-up. Space fighter
  shoots patterns of swirling aliens and stationary cannons, collects extras and
  fights boss ships ‚Äì Bedlam is ordinary shoot‚Äôem-up material, stretched out
  over 16 short levels and spiced up with your standard two-player option. While
  ZX Spectrum and C64 see a genuine space shooter with full-screen backgrounds
  and level variations, CPC and DOS get bare-bone versions stripped down to
  Galaga level.
