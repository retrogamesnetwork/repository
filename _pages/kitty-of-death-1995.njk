description: "This compact game takes up less than 256 bytes (254 to be exact),
  and challenges you to a mortal duel against Evil Kitty who's menacing your
  garden of shrubs.  To be precise, he's eating them all and you're none too
  pleased about that.  Since the kitty's evilness is too much to take on
  bare-handed, you've decided to bring along a remotely-guided missile to zonk
  him with - trouble is, being a kitty, the Evil One has nine lives while you
  have to make do with one.  To top it off, you risk blowing yourself up as
  well! Your character can run in four directions through the shrub garden to
  evade the heinous green kitty, who keeps trying to close in for the kill.  All
  moving objects can wrap around the edges of the screen.  The shrubs will block
  your path, but not Kitty's, since he eats through them with ease; your remote
  control missile simply bounces off them, but otherwise it will follow your
  direction of movement.  Kitty's remaining lives are displayed at the top left:
  if you can exploit the environment and maneuver the missile to snuff him, the
  number will decrease and a new random screen will be generated.  If you can
  get him down to 0 you'll have solved your feline problem once and for all."
