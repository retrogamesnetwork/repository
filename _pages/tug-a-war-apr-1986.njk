description: "A type-in BASIC strategy game for two players.  The game board
  consists of a row of colored squares, with the players' home squares on both
  ends, and a ball at the center.  Each side's goal is to get the ball to their
  home square.  Taking turns, the players flip a number of squares to change
  their colors: the four possible colors move the ball one or two steps in each
  direction - when the square at the ball's position is flipped, the ball will
  move accordingly."
