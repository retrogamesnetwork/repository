description: Tetrolis is a Tetris clone for up to two players. The game is
  played with blocks.  There are 7 different types of blocks that you will
  encounter, and each has a different shape.  The idea of the game is to fill a
  line of the pit, so that there will be no blocks left. Then the line
  disappears, and the rest of the blocks fall down by a line.  Once the top of
  the pit is reached, the game is over. The game allows to play in three play
  modes.
