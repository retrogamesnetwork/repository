description: This baseball simulation from Micro Sports Incorporated has all the
  standard features one expects to find including league play, team management,
  detailed statistics, drafts, trades, and accurately modeled stadiums.  It
  bears the official seal of Major League Baseball and includes the full rosters
  for the 1991 season (along with a long abandoned download function for annual
  updates).  Pro League also uses Real Sound audio (for those who have not yet
  bought one of them newfangled Sound Blaster thingies).
