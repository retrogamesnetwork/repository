description: "Westfront Omega: The Amulet Of Vega is a text adventure for
  Windows written in QBASIC. The player's task is to locate the eponymous amulet
  which your uncle claims is worth millions. The search will take the player
  around their local neighbourhood which includes their parent's house, the
  local school, a castle and a forest. The author has based the game, loosely,
  on Yoshi's Birthday. Many instructions can be abbreviated to a single letter,
  e.g. L for LOOK. The player is also able to define up to ten aliases by which
  commonly used instructions can be referenced more conveniently."
