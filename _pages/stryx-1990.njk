description: You star as half-robot operative Stryx. Dome City is under attack
  by KILLER CYBORG ASSASSINS! You navigate Stryx through numerous levels on
  foot, hovercrafts and some weird round eyeball-type flying craft. It's basic
  side scrolling action/arcade whackiness. This game was released for IBM PC,
  Amiga and Atari ST systems.
