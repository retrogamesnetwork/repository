description: "You take the role of Mark Hopper, an ordinary teenager who gets
  hired by the RGB intelligence (he was selected by a fortune teller) to solve
  the mystery of gold disappearing from the Mega Bank. But first you're sent to
  the RGB training camp where you'll have to pass the three trials! Teenagent is
  a humorous point-and-click adventure, originally available as shareware, but
  the DOS version was later re-released as freeware. You control Mark Hopper
  with a mouse - click on where you want him to go, left-click on objects and
  people to look at them, and right-click on them to interact with them. By
  moving the cursor to the top of the screen, you bring up your inventory.
  (Note: the game isn't connected in any way to the 1991 movie Teen Agent.)"
