description: NFL Coaches Club Football is an American football simulation, the
  first in a short-lived series from MicroProse. The game features the teams and
  players of the 1993 NFL season, and has both single game and league modes.
  Also included are comprehensive team and playbook editors. Each of the 80
  offensive and 80 defensive plays that come with the game can be modified by
  changing formations and positions as well as individual commands for each
  player. The plays can also be compiled into playbooks at will. In the team
  editor, team ratings, the player roster, the starting players, and even
  strategies for each coach are adjustable. Actual game play can be done in
  either Coach mode (only the plays are called) or Action mode (players are
  controlled as well). During playcalling the camera is set behind and above the
  line of scrimmage, but moves in accordance with the action, moving to
  different angles when there is a long pass or a field goal attempt, for
  example. The game allows the recording and playback of plays as files and
  features digitized speech for players and referees.
