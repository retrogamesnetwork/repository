description: The Vixen is the last human on the planet Granath, which is now
  ruled by a race of dinosaurs. She has been raised by foxes, and intends to
  follow through on a promise she made to her elders to wipe them out and
  restore the planet to humanity. Each level must be completed within a time
  limit, but progressing from left to right. She is armed with a whip, a useful
  weapon for attacking the denizens of dinosaurs on each level. Lots of bonus
  items can also be whipped to activate them - bonus lives and extra time for
  example. Tokens to turn into a fox can also be collected - enough of these
  takes you into a bonus level set underground.
