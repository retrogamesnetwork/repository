description: "Pirada I: The Fearless is a shareware card game. It is one of a
  trilogy of games, the others being Pirada II: The Powerful and Pirada III: The
  Invincible, parts two and three of the trilogy were only available to those
  who registered the shareware game. As far as game-play goes this is a bit like
  a blackjack version of Poker Squares but with elements of Minesweeper thrown
  in. The player starts with three lives and twenty-five cards laid out face
  down in a 5x5 grid. By clicking on a card they turn it over the object being
  to achieve blackjack, a score of twenty-one, in as many horizontal and
  vertical lines as possible. For every score of twenty one they achieve the
  player receives a credit. Every time they fail to score at least one blackjack
  score they lose a life. Some cards will reveal a grenade when turned over,
  when this happens the player must declare their hand before the grenade
  explodes (it's on a countdown timer) otherwise they lose a life. Later in the
  game cards with balloons appear, these allow the player to exchange credits
  for an extra life. There is no save game feature, nor is there a high score
  table."
