description: "It's been five years since the Ghostbusters roasted the 30 story
  marshmallow menacing downtown Manhattan. The Ghostbusters sent a huge bill to
  the city and the city sent back an even bigger bill for damages. Both declared
  bankruptcy and the now retired Ghostbusters have since moved on. Unknown to
  the former Ghostbusters, a river of slime has been amassing underneath the
  city, feeding on all the negative energy of the denizens of New York.
  Meanwhile a new occupant of the Museum of Art, a 300 year old painting of Vigo
  the Carpathian and its immortal soul, has arrived and is waiting to get out,
  eager to use the approaching slime as its medium of escape. The game starts
  with the Ghostbusters in trial, with escaped ghosts wrecking havoc in the
  courtroom. A battle ensues and the player must attempt to vaporize the flying
  ghost in a sidescrolling environment while dodging ectoplasm thrown by the
  ghost. Victory or defeat in this battle as well as future battles with ghosts,
  will be summarized by a newspaper editorial at the end of the battle. After
  the courtroom battle, the main game starts in the office of the Ghostbusters.
  Here the player choose various activities, such as: attempt to gain money by
  answering distress calls to hunt down ghosts, collect slime from the sewers,
  test slime (if successfully collected from the sewers), and check the duty
  rooster."
