description: Vetka ( –í–µ—Ç–∫–∞ - Branch in Russian) is a Pipe Dream variant. The
  puzzle task is to connect each burgeon on the grid field to the live branch by
  adjusting and turning other branches scattered around. There are six levels of
  difficulty, which differ by size of the puzzle. On the last difficulty level
  opposite edges of the field are stuck one with another, so the field becomes
  non-edged (mathematicians would say that the field is a torus). The player
  should click a grid's cell to rotate it in order to make a correct connection
  with neighbor cell. Click left mouse button to rotate cell counter-clockwise.
  Click right button to rotate cell clockwise. Player's skill in assembling the
  branch is calculated during the game and saved in the score table if the
  player reaches the top ten result. The less is the time of player's successful
  actions and the less is the number of waste (not necessary) turns, the greater
  the score is. Top ten table is the same for all difficulty levels.
