  game made with DISAC engine. Five kinds of colored fonts, three stand-alone
  picture screens, and one stand-alone midi music file are included in the
  package available for download. The story starts with the conversation of
  mysterious persons about four prototypes and coded message received from outer
  space. Player takes a role of man, who is sitting on the toilet after
  yesterday party with his friends at the bar. Also this man remembers that he
  has found a precious pyramid on the street, and he thought that it should
  bring him a luck. The next actions are controlled with typing in the sentences

  the protagonist is sucked into whirlwind to be placed in complete darkness.
