description: "Bust-A-Move is an unofficial conversion of the classic puzzle
  game. Based on the SNES version, it copies many of its modes and levels, but
  is also missing some elements. The basic gameplay is the same as in other
  versions: the player controls a cannon at the bottom of the screen that shoots
  bubbles of random colors. The goal is to fire the bubbles in such a way that
  they connect to others of the same color. Once three or more of the same color
  touch, they are removed. The ceiling of the play area continually descends.
  The game is lost if any bubbles reach the bottom and won once all bubbles are
  cleared. The single player puzzle mode consists of 90 puzzles.  Many of the
  levels are direct adaptations from the SNES, but without any of the special
  bubbles like explosive or lightning bubbles. There also is no bonus for quick
  level completion or making many bubbles fall at once. A password feature
  allows continuation from the last level played. There is also a versus mode
  that can be played either against the AI (with six difficulty settings) or
  against a second player. The goal here is to either clear the field of bubbles
  first or make the other player fail. Successfully clearing bubbles sends extra
  bubbles over to the other player. Finally, there is the challenge mode. In
  this endless mode, instead of the ceiling moving towards the bottom, more
  bubbles are constantly refilled from the top. There is no way to win: it is
  played for a high score."
