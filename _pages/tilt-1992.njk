description: Tilt is a puzzle platform action, where the goal is to lead the
  ball through the maze from the entrance to the exit, collecting randomly
  appeared cans and avoiding obstacles such as magnets, red buttons, stop signs,
  holes and other traps to do not make your bonus low or to do not die. To
  provide the clear way for the ball, you should move the tiles of the maze in
  way of famous '15 puzzle' game. As time flows, the bonus size lowers, and you
  should perform your mission on each level as fast as possible. Several
  difficulty levels, speed of the ball, number of players (1-2) may be adjusted.
  The two-players mode is cooperative. The editor of the mazes are also present
  in Amiga and DOS versions.
