description: Throwland is similar to Plotting. The objective of the player, in
  each level, is to make disappear all the colour blocks from the screen,
  throwing blocks of the same color. The game is structured in phases. Each
  phase contains five levels. There are a limited amount of time in each level
  to accomplish the mission.
