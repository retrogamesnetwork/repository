description: "Not your everyday genre-crossover: this game fuses an arcade space
  shooter with a... medical simulation.  You command a patrolling space vessel,
  defending your planet from a devastating attack of biological warfare.  But
  destroying the plague-bearing enemy ships won't be enough; you'll also have to
  stop the epidemic by testing experimental medicine on patients. The game
  starts as a pseudo-3D shoot-'em-up, with the objective of destroying the
  hostile forces before your ship runs out of fuel.  Enemy vessels continuously
  drop \"bio-bombs\", so a quick victory will mean a longer life for your
  patients, but don't shoot down friendly medical ships, as they carry vital
  supplies of serum which you'll be needing soon! If you can wipe out the enemy
  fleet, you get to play doctor - time ticks away, and you must use the
  surviving serum to find a cure for the plague.  There are three drugs you can
  mix: inject the dying patients with different combinations, observe the
  resulting blood tests, and try to refine your formula accordingly.  If the
  blood cell count reaches a million, you'll have the cure... better get to it
  before all your patients kick the bucket!"
