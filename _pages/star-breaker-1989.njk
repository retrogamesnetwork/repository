description: This futuristic shooter combines two distinct styles of gameplay
  into a multi-level romp through space.  The colony planets of New Chicago have
  been overrun by gangs of Rrampon invaders, and a state-of-the-art space
  cruiser has been sent in to purge the infestation.  It's up to the Star
  Breaker, and its android pilot, to destroy the enemy's airborne forces and
  dispatch the interlopers underground. The main section of each level takes
  place above the surface of one of the lifeless planets, and plays like a
  Defender -style shoot-'em-up. The Star Breaker can fly in four directions as
  it tracks down the Rrampon forces on its radar display - from mines and
  suicide droids to the dreaded Harvester command ships.  The docking bays on
  the surface provide access to the underground bases. Here, control is
  transferred to the Light Trooper android, which heads down to the tunnels to
  hunt down the overlords and their Space Clams.  The android can either fly
  through the rooms using its thrusters, or walk on the ground; computer
  terminals provide status reports, and can resupply the player with ammo,
  shields, thruster power and bombs. When the base is cleared, a self-destruct
  code can be activated, giving the player a few seconds to evacuate. The level
  is completed when every base has been destroyed, and all the command vessels
  have been shot down from the skies.
