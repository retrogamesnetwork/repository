description: "A PC version of the traditional Chinese tile game Mahjong, for one
  human player contending against three computer-controlled rivals.  The game is
  similar to rummy: each player starts with an assortment of 14 playing tiles -
  one tile may be discarded per turn, and a new one obtained.  Tiles discarded
  by the other players may be claimed in order to complete an identical set, or
  a consecutive run of the same suit. To win, a player must declare mahjong by
  filling out four complete sets and a pair. Certain difficult-to-obtain hands
  are awarded with a higher score; three variations on the rules and three skill
  levels are available, and the game keeps track of the best scores for each."
