description: "Pearl Harbour takes you back to December 7th, 1942 (curiously,
  that's exactly one year after the historical battle -- then again, hardly the
  worst case of revisionism in gaming).  You're put in charge of an
  anti-aircraft gun overlooking the waters, just as the first Japanese planes
  are sighted over the horizon.  Your objective: shoot them down before they
  sink the whole fleet - or take you out. The game presents the action from a
  first-person view, and boasts some realistic simulation aspects: the speeds of
  enemy aircraft, falling bombs and fired shells are true to life (relative to
  each other); ballistic trajectory must be taken into account when
  targeting.  The Japanese bombers go for the standing ships first - the more
  they manage to sink, the higher the probability that they'll target your
  position instead (this is displayed as a number, next to your kill count).
  When the fleet or your gun are destroyed, the game is over. The shareware
  version limits you to 200 rounds of ammo; the registered version removes this
  limit, keeps track of high scores, and includes the game's source code."
