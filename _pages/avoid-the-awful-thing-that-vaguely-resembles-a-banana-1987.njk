description: In this text-mode game the player controls a spidery-looking thing,
  which prowls the random, wrap-around playfield trying to dodge the titular
  ASCII monstrosity.  The screen is littered with Small Red Things that Passably
  Resemble Flowers, all of which must be collected in order to proceed to the
  next round; some of them will have a "power pill" effect (temporarily allowing
  the player to devour the enemy for points).  Later stages introduce additional
  foes that get faster and meaner as the game goes on, including a Brown Object
  that Looks Somewhat Like a Hamburger.  Needless to say, any run-ins with these
  evil edibles will result in a most ghastly demise.
