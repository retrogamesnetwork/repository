description: "In Sea Rogue you assume command of a five person treasure hunting
  team that searches possible underwater sites for sunken treasure and
  artifacts. Sea Rogue allows the player to train the crew for different roles,
  for example divers that search the wreck while trying to stay out of the way
  of sharks, scientists that conduct research and examine historical artifacts
  and engineers that take care of the mechanical operation of your ship or
  submarine. Real-life shipwrecks are present in the game, including the
  Titanic. Of course, you have a rival for most of the game who is known as
  'Evil Eddy' - the richest man in the world - and the goal of the game is to
  beat Eddy by becoming rich enough to purchase the ultimate submarine: the Sea
  Rogue."
