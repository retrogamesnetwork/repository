description: "Noddy's Playtime is an edutainment game aimed at children between
  3 to 8 years old. The game is based around Enid Blyton's Noddy books, and the
  accompanying TV series. It consists of several mini-games, accessed by a
  driving section where the player drives Noddy's car between different places
  in Toytown. The games are: Railway Station (memory game), Post Office (maths),
  Market Place (reading), Chimney House (music), Noah's Ark (jigsaw puzzle),
  Farm Yard (matching), N & B Works (odd-one-out) and Noddy's Paint Pot (art).
  The different ages that the game is aimed at are catered for by having three
  different difficulty levels which make the games harder for older children."
