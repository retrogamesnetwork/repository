description: Wait, you say, wasn't this an Infocom title? Actually, this one
  came out first on the budget publisher Mastertronic's catalog. It's a vastly
  different game than the Infocom one - you wander around as one of a number of
  characters trying to build up your rapport with the people, doing battle and
  working your way up to becoming a shogun.
