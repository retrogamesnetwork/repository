  The Adventures Of Dianalee In The Lost temple Of The Aztecs is a shareware,
  single player, two dimensional, platform game. The story behind the game is
  simple. Diana is sitting in her class at school. It's time for the teacher to
  hand out homework, some students get maths, some get essays, Dianalee's
  assignment is to find 'The Orb of Destiny'. The game starts when Diana has
  parachuted into the jungle. First the player must explore the Aztec pyramid to
  find the entrance and once inside they leap from platform to platform looking
  for items and killing baddies with their whip.

  The game is keyboard controlled, has a high score and sound. The shareware release of the game contains only episode one, the registered version of the game contains two more.
