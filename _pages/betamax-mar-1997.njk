description: "Betamax is a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up that sees the player at
  the helm of a fighter ship in hostile space, fighting for survival against
  wave after wave of attacking aliens.  The premise? - take them down, pick up
  the energy balls they leave behind, and exchange them for ship upgrades. These
  upgrades are handled by a power-up system similar to Gradius : collecting an
  energy ball advances the upgrade meter, and the player may choose to activate
  the currently highlighted upgrade at any time.  Each game begins with three
  lives; active ship upgrades stay in effect when a life is lost, although they
  do wear off after a while.  On the other hand, some of them have additional
  levels which improve the power-up's effect if applied more than once."
