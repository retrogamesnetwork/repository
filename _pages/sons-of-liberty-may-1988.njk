description: Three of the key battles of the American War of Independence are
  recreated here. The British army and American patriots can be played by either
  human or computer (with 3 skill levels). Each side's level of reinforcements
  and ammunition can be set on a 5-point scale. The smallest and shortest battle
  is Bunker Hill, while the Battle of Monmouth is distinguished by harsh
  weather, and Saratoga requires a different fighting style to the highly
  regimented one the British unsuccessfully used.
