description: "Joe is a puzzle platformer starring Joe, a jolly green blob
  stranded in a series of deviously-designed mazes.  The only way out of this
  mess is by collecting enough keys to get through the doors barring the way to
  the exit.  This would be simple, but Joe's movements and jumps are strictly
  confined to a grid: any misplaced step or hop can undo your progress, or
  (often enough) drop you to your death - the level design incorporates jumping
  puzzles requiring memorization and precision.  Elements are introduced
  gradually as you go: deadly mines and water; switches, which move bricks
  around and operate lifts; slippery ice; teleporters; poison mushrooms that
  curb your jumping skills, until you can find a cure; and mine carts that can
  be pushed around. On some levels Joe is joined by his yellower twin Jasper,
  and the player can switch control between the two at will.  On occasion,
  Jasper may appear all by himself.  There's also a less-likable acquaintance,
  the purple blobbie Igor, who enjoys standing around and insta-zapping anyone
  else who enters his line-of-sight. When you quit the game you get a password
  that will return you to the last level played; there's also a level editor
  which lets you add to the repertoire of diabolical dungeons."
