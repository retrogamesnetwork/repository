description: Rocks is an Asteroids clone.  Much like in the zap-'em-up hit from
  the arcades, you find yourself inexplicably trapped in a rectangular region of
  space that wraps around on itself on all four sides, populated by successive
  waves of asteroids being hurled in random directions.  Your turn and thrust
  controls allow your ship to cruise around the playfield, equipped with a
  frontal mounted blaster to dispatch the wandering lumps of space rock.  You
  can also brake to restrain your inertial motion. Blasting apart a large rock
  causes it to split in two, and the same goes for the resulting fragments,
  until the smallest chunks are eliminated.  Each consecutive wave brings more
  asteroids into play, and occasionally a suspiciously-square alien craft will
  drop in to menace you as well.
