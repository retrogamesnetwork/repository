description: "Like its predecessor Millionaire, Tycoon is a business simulation
  casting you in the role of an investor - this time in the commodity
  market.  You start out with $10,000 in cash, and your quest is to turn that
  into much more by buying and selling various commodities.  Each game turn
  represents one week, and allows you to survey the market by taking note of
  changing prices, reading the news, and reviewing the contracts on offer before
  you determine your actions.  Your success is measured by your net worth; to
  win, you'll have to attain the status of Tycoon by amassing one million
  dollars. You start out as a Novice, which only lets you trade in a limited
  number of high-margin commodities, and make long-position investments.  If you
  can increase your net worth, more opportunities open up: you may trade in more
  commodities, enjoy smaller margin deposits, and take short positions as well.
  One player may compete at a time, but the game can keep a roster of up to 14
  players with their achievement histories.  There's a single save slot to store
  your session for a later time."
