description: Combat Checkers is a variant of American checkers, with single- or
  two-player mode, but where the pieces have traits from role-playing games to
  calculate the outcome of the moves. The checker pieces have are portrayed as
  individuals with arms and armor, which you can buy at the outset of the game,
  and equip each piece differently. Also the individuals belong to a selectable
  'race' like Humans, Elves, Robots and Ogres with different starting strength
  and resilience values. When jumping over the opponent pieces, the respective
  piece does 'battle' using the attack/defence values to choose the outcome. The
  computer can play either with a predefined set of pieces, equipped by the
  human player, or it can use its own selection, which makes it harder for the
  player. The player can configure and save various piece/equipment setups for
  use in other matches, or play with a predefined set.
