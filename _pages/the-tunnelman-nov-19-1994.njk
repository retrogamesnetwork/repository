description: It seems like you're caved in. Now you have to find your way out!
  TunnelMan is a story about a miner who experiences one of those bad days at
  work, in this case he has to find his way out of the mines. In order to do so,
  he must find the emergency exit that will get him to the upper levels. But it
  seems that the emergency exit is wielded shut, if not humanly impossible to
  open with your bare hands. That means, you have to gather dynamites and the
  detonator available at each level to blow that emergency exit door to kingdom
  come! Watch out, the ceiling looks fragile. It seems that everytime you walk
  pass a brick (ceiling), they fall down behind you. Basically means, one way
  only. This game requires some serious planning, so think ahead before you
  move. Because if you get stuck, your stuck. Game over - Restart.
