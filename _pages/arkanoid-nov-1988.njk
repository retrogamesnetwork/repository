description: The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the
  bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all
  the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for
  over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade
  game. The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an
  energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from
  progressing to safety. By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of
  arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the
  bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go
  for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted
  to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching
  device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time
  you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.
