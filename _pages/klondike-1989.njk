description: Klondike is a single-player, shareware version of the classic
  solitaire game. The game can be played in 'Strict Mode' in which the player
  has just one pass through the stack of undealt cards, or 'Relaxed Mode' in
  which the player can go through the undealt cards multiple times. There is no
  'drag and drop' mechanism for moving cards in this game, the player clicks on
  the card(s) to be moved and then clicks on their destination. There is in-game
  help text, comprehensive game documentation. The game is intended to be played
  with the mouse but can be played with a keyboard.
