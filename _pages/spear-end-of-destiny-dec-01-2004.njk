description: "From the authors who brought us Spear Resurrection comes a direct
  sequel, further extending the storyline of the Spear of Destiny series.  World
  War II is long over, the Spear and its transcendental powers believed lost
  forever, and all Nazi plans for resurgence seemingly thwarted.  But disturbing
  things are brewing in a remote area of the Spanish countryside: an old
  intelligence contact of B.J. Blazkowicz informs him of renewed secret activity
  amongst Nazi holdouts.  Occult machinations are stirring into motion yet
  again, and it's up to B.J. to uncover the shocking truth and stop them... or
  die trying. This installment retains the familiar first-person shooter
  mechanics of the previous games, where B.J. sneaks into a heavily defended
  keep and climbs from level to level by eliminating all opposition, finding
  treasure and secrets along the way.  It is structured as a single extra-long
  'episode' of 25 normal levels plus 12(!) secret ones, featuring new enemies,
  bosses and graphics. The engine is still based on the original SOD source
  code, but has been further extended with new capabilities: additions include
  ceiling and floor textures, distance shading, in-game messages, new types of
  secret areas, more new weapons (a silent stealth-rifle and a rocket launcher),
  portable medkits, wall switches, rocket turrets and flame-throwing
  traps.  There's even an extra challenge for diehard Wolfers - a new game mode
  which only allows a limited number of savegames."
