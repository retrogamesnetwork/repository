description: Ortotris is a Tetris variant. The game takes place in the same
  manner except that the player does not stack bricks but words. The player's
  task is to choose the correct spelling. The correct spelling indicated at the
  bottom of the screen needs to be selected from different choices by using the
  left or right cursor keys. The game highlights a part of the word the player
  needs to decide on. If correct, the selection is deleted, if not, it remains.
  On the right side of the screen displays the percentage of correctness of the
  answers. The game ends with the degree of exposure.The game has a mode of
  practice and theory of all types of polish spelling. The Amiga version of the
  game and DOS v2.0 (released as a part of the Ortomania compilation) include
  the Ortowpis editor, which allows players to add new words to the dictionary.
