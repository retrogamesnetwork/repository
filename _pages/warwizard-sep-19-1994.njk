description: WarWizard is a role-playing game in a medieval fantasy setting. The
  player takes on the role of a WarWizard, a powerful character skilled both in
  combat and magic arts. As the story goes, a Dark WarWizard rose to rule the
  land. It is the player's task to recover the Ancient Armor that was used to
  defeat the previous dark WarWizard, and rid the land of the current menace.
  The player starts alone and must build up his skills and acquire equipment and
  resources. Eventually, up to three other characters may join the player's
  party. The game was distributed via the shareware model, with several complete
  quests included with the shareware version.
