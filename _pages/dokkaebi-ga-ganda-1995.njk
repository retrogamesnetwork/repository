description: Dokkaebi-ga Ganda is a Korean-made colorful platform game. The
  player can choose to control either of the two little kobold protagonists, a
  boy and a girl named Cobi and Comi, respectively. Cobi is armed with a club,
  while Comi fights using a hammer. Both characters, however, control
  identically and can execute special combo moves by inputting combinations of
  keys. The gameplay consists of traversing linearly arranged stages divided
  into themes (forest, cave, village, etc.); each thematic group contains three
  stages, the last of which is a boss battle. Enemies often attack in groups and
  may charge at the protagonist and push him or her off platforms. Most of the
  items the player character can collect (coins, sushi, blue energy flames left
  by defeated enemies, etc.) have no effect on the gameplay and serve only to
  increase the score. Rice bowls, however, replenish a portion of the
  protagonist's health bar; a large bowl refills it completely. The player
  character's overall health is measured by hearts; dying will permanently
  reduce it by one. There are three difficulty levels in the game, and the
  player can also choose the amount of continues, from zero to seven.
