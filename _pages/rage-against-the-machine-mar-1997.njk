description: An adaptation of Berzerk, taking place in a series of scrolling
  maze-like rooms; you are beset by rampaging armies of aliens and robots, and
  have to try and take down as many as you can with the aid of your trusty
  handgun.  Both you and your enemies can fire in eight directions - metal walls
  will deflect any shots that strike them, while the colored barriers are
  destructible.  The more enemies you kill, the more you'll score, although it
  is possible to leave the level at any time by heading towards an exit.  Both
  the overall game speed and the fire speed can be adjusted on the fly.
