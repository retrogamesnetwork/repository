description: Up to four players may take part in this educational game, which
  tests one's factual knowledge of the fifty states comprising the USA.  Two
  basic forms of quiz are included - one is State Comparison, where two random
  states are selected in each turn, and the player is asked to compare different
  aspects of the two (area, population, population density, largest metropolitan
  area, highest elevation).  The other is States Facts, which highlights one
  state at a time and poses factual questions about it (its name, two-letter
  code, capital, largest city, and the year it was admitted into the Union). 3
  difficulty levels are available for the comparison game, and the facts game
  can be set to order the states alphabetically or randomly.  The question timer
  is adjustable (1 minutes, 3 minutes or unlimited), and if you find yourself
  hard-pressed for answers, the computer can be asked for a hint.
