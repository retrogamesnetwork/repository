description: 'Another Laserdisc conversion of one of Don Bluth‚Äôs cartoons: Space
  Ace II: Borf‚Äôs Revenge continues the saga of young cadet Dexter, who tries to
  free his love Kimberly from the clutches of the evil nemesis Borf. In critical
  situations, the meek Dexter can transform into his mighty alter ego Space Ace.
  Thus empowered, he has to defeat Borf‚Äôs minions. Space Ace II is a essentially
  a cartoon strip in which our hero will encounter numerous hazards. You have to
  avoid traps and enemies by pressing the right key at the right time: cursor
  keys for movements, Insert key to shoot. You never control Dexter directly,
  you just choose an appropriate direction. Each of the 27 seconds-long scenes
  requires one to three keystrokes. If your decision is wrong, the cartoon will
  end with a death animation, and Dexter will lose one of his three lives. So
  you‚Äôre basically trying to keep the strip running. Timing is crucial; you will
  need to press keys in the exact second. Luckily, you‚Äôre allowed to save your
  progress at four fixed points. Space Ace II is ported to the PC from the
  original arcade Laserdisc version. The result is a cut version due to space
  restraints. Although Space Ace II comes on 12(!) low density 5 1/4" discs,
  most scenes are shortened noticeably.'
