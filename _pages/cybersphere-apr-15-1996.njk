description: Cybersphere is an arcade game that is fundamentally similar to
  Breakout and Arkanoid. The player controls a "paddle" that can move
  horizontally which is used to direct a bouncing ball to destroy "bricks"
  arranged in different patterns. Some bricks may take several hits to destroy,
  and often drop gems that add to the player's score if collected, or various
  power-ups, including a temporary floor that will prevent the ball from falling
  outside the playing field, an extra ball, a wider paddle or cannons that the
  player may use to destroy more bricks. The game does not feature any kind of
  plot. The levels are broken down into several "sectors", with only the first
  one available in the demo version. In addition to regular levels, there are
  bonus stages that may be accessed by picking a certain bonus item during play.
