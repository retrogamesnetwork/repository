description: "In Alien Cabal, aliens have invaded Earth. Now it is the player's
  responsibility to move through the levels and shoot everything which moves.
  This is a 2,5D shooter played from a first-person perspective. The basic goal
  of every level is to reach the exit - however, there are two main obstacles on
  the way: closed passages (can be opened by finding key cards or pressing
  switches) and enemies which have to be disposed of with weapon force (pistol,
  shotgun, machine gun, grenades and bazooka). When opponents manage to shoot
  the player, some life energy is lost and as soon as it reaches zero, the game
  is over. Besides key cards, there are other useful items lying around the
  levels which can be picked up to stock up health, armor or ammo. The player
  always aims directly in the middle of the screen. To shoot enemies, it is
  required to line up the shot not only horizontally, but also vertically when
  enemies are on a different plain. When finishing a level, a rating is awarded
  based on enemies killed, destroyed objects, found secret areas and picked up
  items."
