description: A remake of the Amiga/Atari ST game from 1989 (see Gravity Force).
  With a similar control scheme and feel to Thrust, the aim is to make your way
  through a series of levels, collecting all cargo containers and returning them
  to your home base. As if controlling your own ship wasn't difficult enough,
  there are numerous enemies patrolling the cave system who seem intent on
  making your job hell. Instead of making a straight remake, the author has
  created some brand new levels and mission types (e.g. escort missions, bombing
  runs), to add variety. There is also a limited version of the original game's
  'single player race' mode (in which you attempt to set new time records for
  completing levels) and a simple 2-player dogfight mode.
