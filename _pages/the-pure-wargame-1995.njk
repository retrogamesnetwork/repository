description: The Pure Wargame is a quintessential turn-based wargame. The first
  one in a proposed series (and the only one released), it involves eight
  different airborne operations centering on tactical level operations of
  airborne warfare, from the scattered landings at Crete to the ill-fated
  bridges of Arnhem.
