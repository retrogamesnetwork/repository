description: 'Fluf! is a maze-based action game which vaguely follows the same
  general idea as Pac-Man, with a few important differences.  Most obviously,
  the maze layouts and the marauding monsters are different from level to level,
  and instead of gobbling up all the dots the goal is to flip the blue squares
  over to red (by simply walking over them).  These factors notwithstanding, the
  baddies still roam the passages and would happily make a meal of our white
  fluffy protagonist should they meet.  Echoing its inspiration, the game throws
  the occasional fruit bonus at the player, but instead of helpful power-pills
  or side tunnels there are deadly traps: the "black hole" tile will end the
  game immediately if encountered, no matter how many lives are left.  One breed
  of nasties will occasionally turn red tiles back into blue, requiring more
  mileage to flip them again. The five highest scores are recorded, but only for
  the current session.  The game is written in Tandy 1000 BASIC and will not
  play properly on other machines.'
