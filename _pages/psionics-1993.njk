description: After a long trip you've finally arrived at the Nexus space lab,
  where curious scientists were to examine your uncanny psychic potential, a
  talent even you couldn't comprehend. Little did you know, getting ready for a
  rest, that you'll be awoken by screams, lights going out, and your examiner
  being eaten alive by huge rabid rats! Psionics is a simple sci-fi dungeon
  crawler in which the player must escape from a maze-like space station. Apart
  from finding a couple of items that will help you in the way, you'll be often
  facing mutated animals, which you may defeat not only using weapons, but also
  your psionic powers.
