description: "This text-mode BASIC game finds you in a large room littered with
  dots.  Your character's goal is to gobble up these essential nutrients,
  without getting caught by the four enemies that patrol the arena.  Your
  movements are limited to straight lines, but your foes can travel diagonally
  as well.  The four side tunnels help you outsmart them: enter one, and you
  emerge at the opposite side of the playfield. More or less, Gobble Man is
  basically Pac-Man without the maze, or the power pills, or the extra lives: a
  single encounter with your ever-smiling oppressors will force you to start
  over from scratch."
