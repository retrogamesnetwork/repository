description: Based on Stephen King's popular horror novel, The Dark Half
  attempts to retell the story of Thad Beaumont's mysterious world of crime via
  an adventure system reminiscent of Lucasarts' SCUMM interface. In-game, you
  play Thad Beaumont, a successful horror-novelist whose evil twin besets the
  world with horrific crimes. The game offers a multitude of clues, quests and
  puzzles. The overall objective seems to be to prove Thad's innocence to the
  police, however Thad soon learns that his twin has other ideas, and has to run
  for his life.
