description: From Corner To Corner is a four-players or two-players turn-based
  board game. The goal for each player is to move all balls from player's corner
  to the opposite corner of the playfield faster than others. The ball can move
  a one space and also jump over a single nearest ball for unlimited times in
  any direction - vertical, horizontal, diagonal. Each turn the player selects
  one ball and points out the destination of the ball's route. The game has an
  option to select human or AI opponents as well as to set a one of four
  difficulty levels.
