description: World Cup 90 is a soccer game capitalizing the event of World Cup
  of 1990 in Italy. All the national teams participating at the event are
  included; however, due to the lack of a license, the players' names are
  fictional. The player can create custom teams (name, tactics and color of the
  jersey) and change the team's roster. Multiplayer features two players mode (1
  vs. 1 or 2 vs. CPU), and through additional interface, it is possible to add
  other two players.
