description: Taking basketball out of poshly-decorated arenas with hotdog
  sellers, cheerleaders and pre-game entertainments, Epyx presented basketball
  played as it is by kids all over America. Four different courts are provided -
  the schoolyard, the alleyway, the parking lot and the backyard. Each of these
  has its own hazards to play around, such as oil slicks and potholes. The
  standard basketball dunks, passes and steals are on offer. An opposition
  player drilling the ball into you sees you gain possession. One or two players
  can join in, choosing their team of 3 from the 10 kids you are offered, each
  with different abilities. There are 3 computer difficulty levels.
