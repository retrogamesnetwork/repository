description: From the days of fighting sail comes this game of combat on the
  high seas. Although produced very early in the PC era (1988), Ralph Bosson's
  High Seas works from a graphical deck view, resorting to a chart view only for
  position checks (which can become important in fleet engagements). It operates
  either on 10-game-minute turns, or interrupt-to-issue-orders mode.  It models
  the effects of wind on maneuvering and the effects of different ammo types
  against the wooden walls and sails of opposing vessels.  A very advanced
  feature included is a scenario designer. The game can be played either
  hot-seated or with a computer opponent.
