description: In Lunar Landing the player gets to take manual control of moon
  lander capsules, and maneuver them to a safe touchdown on the surface by means
  of rocket thrust.  Each lander starts out with a different bearing and
  velocity, and a full complement of fuel; the cursor keys apply thrust in four
  directions to adjust the rocket's trajectory. For a proper landing, it must
  approach a flat section of the surface slowly enough to stay in one
  piece.  Hit the ground too hard, veer off the screen, or run out of fuel in
  mid-flight - and the lander is toast.  Each successful attempt boosts the
  level of challenge with a more uneven and dangerous landscape, and larger
  initial velocities for the rocket.
