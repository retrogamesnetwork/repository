description: Defender is a shareware clone based like many others on Eugene
  Jarvis' classic. As this is a clone the gameplay is identical to the original.
  The player controls a spaceship which they must use to prevent aliens from
  abducting people. This version can be played with the keyboard, mouse or
  joystick. It has a high score table and sound effects.
