description: 'The second volume of the Decisive Battles of the American Civil
  War series allows the player to reenact another five crucial battles of the
  American Civil War: Gaines Mill, Stones River, Gettysburg, Chickamauga,
  Chattanooga. Just as the first volume, this turn-based, hex-based wargame
  focuses on simulating the limited control, communication and "fog of war" of a
  XIX-century battlefield, providing a challenge to the player taking command of
  either North or South forces. Apart from single and two player gameplay
  option, an editor is also available, enabling the creation of own scenarios.'
