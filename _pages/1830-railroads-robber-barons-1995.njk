description: "Based on Avalon Hill's board game of the same name, 1830:
  Railroads & Robber Barons is a railroad empire building game that is along the
  same lines (although a different style of gameplay) as the much more famous
  Railroad Tycoon. Capturing the very look and feel of the board game, all the
  way to the hexagonal playing field and track tokens, 1830 is a turn based game
  that emphasizes the successful running of a company and manipulating the stock
  market rather than managing a railroad. Tracks can be laid, cities connected,
  trains purchased, and schedules set, but the ultimate goal in the end is
  making money, even at the cost of your company; you'll wind up buying and
  selling a number of them during the course of the game anyway."
