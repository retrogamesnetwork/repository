description: Following the events of the first Starflight, the galaxy is at
  relative peace. The balance of power is disrupted when the Spemin, usually a
  minor nuisance, suddenly gain technological superiority and begin a campaign
  of expansionism. Through investigation, Interstel determines that the Spemin
  technology is not their own and that they have obtained it from somewhere on
  the other side of a flux (wormhole). Interstel commissions a force to visit
  this area, called the Cloud Nebula, and find a way to nullify the Spemin
  technology. Starflight 2 is a space exploration game that contains much of the
  interface from its predecessor. This includes crew management, ship
  improvement, resource collection, planet landings, alien diplomacy and
  exploration of a new galaxy. Much of the gameplay takes place via a standard
  interface that allows access to ship stations. Landing on a planet however
  will shift to an overhead view and the player manually controls his rover
  while searching for objects of interest. New to Starflight 2 is trading, alien
  races will now buy and sell unique items at different prices, it is no longer
  necessary to return to the Interstel starport to sell resources. As mentioned,
  the galaxy itself and the alien races that inhabit it are also new. New
  technologies exist for the player such as Blasto Pods (torpedoes); a
  devastating weapon, and Jump Pods; which will transport anywhere on the
  starmap.
