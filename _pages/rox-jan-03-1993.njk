description: ROX is an Asteroids variant, where you pilot a spaceship and shoot
  asteroids and spaceships.The screen wraps around left/right and up/down, so
  what goes off the screen in one direction comes back from the other. You have
  three lives and unlimited ammunition for one session. If you clear the whole
  area, new asteroids are spawned off screen. An enemy spaceship will
  periodically come and shoot at you, and if you don't avoid it or the
  asteroids, your ship is destroyed. The ship has a laser shooting forward, it
  can turn and accelerate, and there is an emergency warp, in case you get boxed
  in. If you are successful, you will end up in a Hall of Fame list, and some
  statistics will show for your next game.
