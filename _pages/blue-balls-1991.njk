description: BlueBalls is a single-player puzzle game. The player controls a
  small white dot which they navigate around the screen using the numeric
  keypad. The object of the game is to eliminate, i.e. crash into, blue balls
  that appear on the screen. The more balls that are collected the more points
  are earned. Blue balls appear randomly in the game area. After a while they
  disappear and reappear somewhere else, something that also happens when one is
  captured. Also appearing randomly on the screen are mines which can be
  collected before they detonate and leave behind a black hole. A life is lost
  when the player hits the edge of the screen, any wall in the game area, a
  black hole, any of the red balls they leave behind in their wake. The game's
  documentation says the game is sensitive to the CPU speed. This together with
  starting level, number of lives, and game speed are set via command line
  parameters when the game loads.
