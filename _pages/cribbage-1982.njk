description: An adaptation of the traditional card game, for one player against
  a computer rival, where each side attempts to beat the opponent to the goal of
  121 points. To start with, the deck is cut and the lowest card determine who
  deals first.  Each side receives six cards, discards two to the crib, then
  both take turns playing their hand to the board - attempting to score by
  bringing the total value to 15 or 31, and by completing certain card
  combinations that score additional points. "Go" is called if no cards can be
  played without going over a total of 31, and the attempt is transferred to the
  opponent; the last player to place a card gets an additional point. When all
  cards have been played, both hands are scored according to their contents and
  special combinations, and the score for the crib goes to its owner (each side
  gets the crib on alternating turns).  A new round begins, and so on until one
  of the players hits a total 121 or above - winning the game.
