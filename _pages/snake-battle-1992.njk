description: Snake Battle is a programming game where the player trains his own
  snake to participate in the snake battle matches. Each snake can have own
  color, programmed AI, and it is password-protected. Training is concluded in
  pre-defining the nine schemes of possible snake behaviours on the battlefield.
  The player does not control the snake directly. Each match requires up to four
  snakes on the battlefield, and the goal of each snake is to eat the tail of
  another snake. With each eaten tail the snake is increased, and the snake
  without tail is reduced. The winner of the match is a snake with a greater
  length.
