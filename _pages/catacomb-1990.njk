description: 'If you look too hard for a plot you might strain yourself; in what
  was pretty par for the course at the time, you guide a projectile-firing hero
  (nuanced shot types: little, big, and Really Big) through 10 levels in the DOS
  version or 15 levels in the Apple II and Apple IIgs versions (30 more in its
  look-alike sequel The Catacomb) of twisty, monster-filled mazes in what might
  critically be reduced to a pretty diluted Gauntlet derivative: advance through
  stages, avoid getting killed, rack up points and offensive bonuses. The game
  is mostly of interest for historical value: its preoccupation with secret
  passages (here revealed by being shot) and an unprecedented "strafe"
  functionality hint at what lay ahead for its crew, for when you extrude the
  maze into three dimensions and shift from third-person to a first-person
  perspective, what you end up with is Catacomb 3-D... from which it is (and
  was, as it turns out for wunderkind Carmack), only a hop, skip and a jump to
  Wolfenstein 3D and DOOM.'
