description: You are Vietnam war veteran Bret Conrad,  who becomes an
  adventurer. Go everywhere on the world, find gold, walk in to the jungle...
  One day, you receive an old map about the lost city of Quetzacotl, and its
  cache of gold. You prepare your bag, gun, knife and let's go to the adventure
  ! In gameplay Gold of the Aztecs is similar to Psygnosis' Barbarian (by the
  same author), and you must go screen by screen to finish it. Over 140 main
  character movements are included. There are traps at each screen like stones
  or dangerous bridge.
