description: Lace up those boots soldier, and get ready for five levels of
  challenging action in this boot camp simulator. As make your way through
  various levels you'll be given points for doing the right thing and deducted
  points for any missteps. You can record your attempts and review them, to spot
  your mistakes and learn from them. Level one is the Physical course, which
  requires you to jump over walls, jump trenches and crawl under barbwire. Level
  two is the Risk course. This one will have you planting dynamite and throwing
  grenades. Level three has the player going hand-to-hand in the Combat course.
  The fourth level combines the previous three levels into one, and finally, the
  fifth level is a custom "Cobra" course that throws random elements from all
  the courses at the player. To give the game replay value, there is a course
  construction set so that you can make your own levels. The Atari ST and Amiga
  versions contain digitized sound.
