description: 'In The Awe-Chasm, the player takes the role of Snatch and Crunch
  which visit the Awe-Chasm in search for treasure. And that is also the whole
  extend of the background story: the goal is simply to find all treasure and
  earn all 500 points. In order to solve puzzles, the player writes sentences
  into the parser. The player can switch between the two characters which have
  different abilities (Crunch is a "monolithic mutant" and Snatch a "pokey
  pervert") and can interact, e.g. Crunch can pick up Snatch. This is required
  to solve some puzzles. The game features sexual humour.'
