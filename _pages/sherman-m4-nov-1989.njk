description: Sherman M4 is a 3D tank simulator. It is set in World War II and
  includes 3 campaigns; Normandy, Ardennes and Desert. You have up to four M4s,
  two jeeps and artillery support to complete each mission. The Germans have
  four different kinds of tanks, bunkers etc. Objectives include destroying
  bridges, capturing towns, rescuing jeeps and destroying convoys. You can drive
  one tank at a time and give the others movement orders on a map. They will
  automatically attack enemies they encounter. The map is also used for moving
  jeeps and calling artillery strikes. Your tanks can be repaired, refueled and
  rearmed if you capture hangers in some missions. Before each mission you can
  alter several realism options as well as the enemy moral, experience and
  commander.
