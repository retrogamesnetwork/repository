description: A sliding puzzle game similar to classic picture puzzle games
  however instead of completing an image you slide numbered blocks 1 through 16
  into order. The game starts with the numbers in a scrambled order, just like
  in the picture puzzle. There is always one empty square into which you can
  slide one of the surrounding 4 blocks. The object of the game is to slide all
  the blocks back into their original numerical order. The problem is that since
  you have only one empty square to work with when arranging the blocks you
  inevitably place the puzzle further out of order in your attempts to solve the
  puzzle.
