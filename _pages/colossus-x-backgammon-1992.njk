  Colossus X Backgammon is a single-player, mouse-controlled DOS implementation
  of Backgammon. The game plays in CGA and EGA modes and has the following
  features:

  Games can be saved, loaded and replayed.

  Players can undo and redo moves - referred to in-game as 'Backward-step' and 'Forward-step'.

  There is a Blindfold option where The player's pieces, the AI opponent's pieces, or both are hidden.

  The player can play against the computer or they can play both sides. The pieces are moved by either clicking on first the piece and then the destination, alternatively the player cal click on a piece and drag-and-drop it. Where there is only one legal move the game will automatically move the piece when it is clicked on. Dice are rolled by clicking anywhere in the game area. The game communicates with the player via a message area at the bottom of the screen and has an in-game option to change the language of these messages, the languages changed by entering English, Francais, Deutsch, Espanol or Italiano at the appropriate prompt.
