description: In the 14th century, England has a presence in France, and as
  Charles, it's up to you to get rid of them. You are heir to the throne, and
  will have power if you can recapture the city of Rheims from the English, with
  Joan's help as everybody else thinks it's a lost cause. Combat is one major
  aspect of this arcade-strategy hybrid. Armies are made up of archers, cavalry
  and foot soldiers, whose movement and firing angle must be controlled.
  Storming a city also involves defeating some staunch defences. Once you have
  overall control, your goal is to reunite France, by retaking each city in
  turn. You must raise taxes so as to have the adequate funds (but don't let
  provinces become unhappy, they can rebel), and use this money to fund a big
  army. Sometimes the pen is mightier than the sword though - many devious
  diplomatic tactics are available, including bribery and poison.
