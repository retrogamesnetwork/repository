description: "Billy the Kid is set in the Wild West and features William H.
  Bonney, the famous outlaw also known as Billy the Kid, and his adversary
  Sheriff Pat Garrett. Both are hired by the rancher John Tunstall to protect
  Lincoln County from outlaws. Unfortunately Tunstall is murdered and the two
  disagree how to proceed: while Garrett wants to strengthen law and order,
  Billy the Kid sets out to avenge Tunstall the hard way. The player chooses
  between the role of Billy the Kid or Garrett which changes their goals, e.g.
  as Billy the Kid the player needs to build up an outlaw army. During the game,
  the next destination is chosen through an overhead map, e.g. the city of Santa
  Fe or a camp of Native Americans. In cities, the player can move, enter
  different buildings and talk to people in order to receive hints what to do
  next (sometimes hints are also received when entering one of the other
  locations on the map). Some people need to be bribed with money which can be
  earned with certain actions like robbing a bank. Often the character has to
  engage in action sequences, e.g. a shootout in which crosshairs are moved over
  the screen to shoot enemies as soon as they leave their cover. When the basic
  goal is reached, the game culminates in a shootout between Billy the Kid and
  Garrett."
