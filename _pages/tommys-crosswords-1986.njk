description: Tommy's Crosswords is a single-player crossword game. This game
  comes with thirty-nine pre-made crosswords and an editor so that players can
  create and share their own puzzles. In Solution mode it has two cheat modes,
  one gives the player the current letter, as indicated by the cursor, and the
  other gives the entire word. In Creation mode there's an optional encryption
  feature to prevent others cheating. There are also two command line switches
  one to force a colour display and another to force a monochrome display.
