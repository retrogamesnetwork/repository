description: There is a crime wave in the town of Huxley! As a mystery master,
  you need to help the police solve 12 different crimes that have taken place.
  Throughout each of the cases you can interrogate suspects, search for clues at
  various locations, or use police station resources to analyze clues. To win
  you need to find out who the criminal is within the given time limit, as well
  as collect enough evidence to convict him and send him to jail. Included with
  the game is a manual which contains the story for each of the 12 cases along
  with hundreds of clues. When the computer reveals clues from searches or
  questioning, it will give you a number which needs to be looked up in the
  manual for more information. To be successful, you will need to study the back
  story carefully and take notes as the plot unfolds! The game can be played by
  just one player, or up to four players can compete against each other to see
  who solves the case first.
