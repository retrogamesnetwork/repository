  Terminal Terror is the sequel to Lethal Tender. Once again you step in the
  shoes of super spy/army-of-one hero Nick Hunter and this time around your
  mission is to take back into custody the international terrorist Bruno Riggs
  who has escaped jail thanks to the aid of a new terrorist cell that has some
  nasty plans in store for the world. Gameplay evolves from the straightforward
  Doom-cloned FPS action of the original and introduces a lot of innovative
  features that were surprisingly ahead of it's day for a FPS, such as branching
  and optional missions, stealth-oriented sequences which make use of non-lethal
  weapons and a stealth meter (named as the "profile") which allow you to avoid
  detection based on your current speed, readied weapon, etc. Combat also
  incorporates a power bar which depletes the longer you keep firing and adds a
  primitive but effective hit-detection system which inflicts different types of
  effects on your character depending on where he is hit (damaged legs slow you
  down or make your character turn towards a certain direction when moving as if
  he were limping, damaged arms affect your aim, damaged eyes blur your vision,
  etc.).

  The game also incorporates an inventory/equipment bar for item management and throws civilians and allies into the mix, which will turn on you or cost you mission objectives if you shoot them or fail to protect them.
