description: Fifteen Puzzle simulates the classic mechanical puzzle game, with
  15 numbered tiles jumbled randomly within a 4x4 square, and one tile
  missing.  The goal is to arrange the numbers in order; a move is made by
  sliding an adjacent tile into the empty position (shown as "0" here), and the
  game keeps track of the number of moves taken.
