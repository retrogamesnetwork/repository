description: Korean Dungeon Boy is a first-person dungeon-crawling shooter with
  pseudo-3D monochrome graphics. The player controls the titular character as he
  runs through labyrinths, trying to reach the exit before the time allotted for
  the stage completion runs out. Combat is action-based, with free movement and
  attacking; the players needs to move a cursor with the arrow keys to aim and
  shoot. The hero is equipped with various firearms, most of which require
  ammunition, while others need batteries to function. Batteries also power-up
  the protagonist's armor and the radar that displays a mini-map of the stage,
  and must be found and collected regularly. The hero can also cast spells,
  which work like expendable items.
