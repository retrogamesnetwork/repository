description: Hacker is an adventure/trading game based on what was then a unique
  idea. You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking
  information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently,
  the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password.
  To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve. Once in,
  you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of
  global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe
  through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface
  and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to
  the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all
  evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the
  correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and
  security checks test your skill as well...
