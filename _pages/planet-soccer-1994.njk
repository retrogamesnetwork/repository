description: This football game features practically every international team
  available with its corresponding players (circa 1994) and with gameplay modes
  that include 1 and 2 player exhibition matches and the full World Cup. The
  distinguishing feature of the game is its use of a different perspective which
  puts you behind and above the players as in 3rd person 3D games, but in a
  fixed position where the camera just slides up and down the court to follow
  the players. Graphics are 2D VGA sprites
