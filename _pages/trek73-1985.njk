description: Trek73 allows players to simulate space battles between various
  vessels from the Star Trek franchise. It takes inspiration from the board game
  Star Fleet Battles. The game is played against the computer. Both the player
  and the computer input their commands (fire phasers, change course, launch
  antimatter pods, surrender, etc.) which are afterwards executed
  simultaneously. The game continues until either side is destroyed,
  outmanoeuvred or surrenders. There are a total of 31 different actions that
  can be taken each turn.
