description: "Memory Castle is an educational game where the player is a knight
  who has to enter and accomplish tasks in a castle. The game gives instructions
  to the player who has to memorize them. The player is then asked questions on
  what should be done next, for example where to go, and has to answer correctly
  to progress through the game. An incorrect answer leads to the game ending.
  The game has three difficulty levels which differ in number of tasks: easy (6
  instructions), medium (12 instructions) and difficult (20 instructions). Upon
  completion a reward is given which is different for each level."
