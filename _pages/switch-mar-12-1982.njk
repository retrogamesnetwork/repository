description: "Switch is a translation of an old brain-teaser, also known as the
  'leapfrog puzzle'.  The are a two sets of pegs on the board - five red ones on
  the left, and five green ones on the right, with a single space in the
  middle.  The idea is to fully switch the positions of the two groups by moving
  one peg at a time, with restrictions: pegs can only be moved into the blank
  space, either by a single step or by leaping over another peg.  Red pegs move
  only to the right, and green pegs move only to the left.  The game keeps track
  of the number of moves made."
