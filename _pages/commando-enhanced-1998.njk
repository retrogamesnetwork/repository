description: Commando Enhanced is an unofficial remake of the arcade game
  Commando. Like the original it is a 2D top-down shooter where the player
  controls a commando. He has a gun with an unlimited supply of ammo and several
  grenades, and he must go straightforward and kill enemies along the way way.
  Turrets can be destroyed by blowing them up. While most gameplay elements
  resemble the original game, there are additions such as new enemy types, the
  ability to pick and use grenades, body armor and other items, and the ability
  to call in airstrikes.
