description: A simple variation of the classic game of  Mahjongg (also known as
  Shanghai). Each of the 40 levels consist of rows and piles of tiles, patterned
  with symbols such as butterflies and masks. Pair them up within the time limit
  to move on a level. The difficulty is that a tile can only be moved if it has
  no tile on top of it, and a gap either to the left or right (or both). Careful
  planning ahead is required if all tiles are to be cleared.
