description: Dune III is a fan-made game set in the Dune universe created by
  Frank Herbert. The game uses graphics from Westwood Studios' Dune II, however
  it is not a real-time strategy game, but a turn-based tactics game instead.
  The plot in Dune III is loosely based on Frank Herbert's books, combining
  elements from both earlier and later instalments in the Dune Chronicles. As
  the Bashar in the service of Emperor Leto Atreides, the player must defend the
  planet Rakis, which is the only source of spice melange in the universe, from
  attacks by the Ixians, the Tleilaxu and the people from the Scattering who
  wish to occupy Rakis and take control of the spice production. The campaign
  consists of a variety of missions, both defensive and offensive, but usually
  the primary objective is to completely eliminate enemy forces with the limited
  number of units that are provided at the start of each mission. Units have a
  limited number of movement points that can be spent each turn on movement,
  attacks, or both. There are three terrain types - sand, rocks and roads - and
  each has a different movement cost in points, with roads being the fastest way
  of travel, and sand the slowest. Unit attack strength greatly depends on the
  number of available movement points, which means that a unit that had
  previously moved in a turn will deal less damage to its target than a
  stationary unit that attacks right away at the start of the turn. The game
  does not support multiplayer mode, and only allows to save the player's
  progress upon exit. A certain element of surprise is added by the random
  placement of enemy units at the start of each mission; map terrain, however,
  remains the same each time.
