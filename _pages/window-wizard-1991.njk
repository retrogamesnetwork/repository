description: "In Window Wizard the player takes the role of Willy, the window
  cleaner. Willy has a big job: cleaning the windows of a house with multiple
  floors. The goal of each level is to clean every window while avoiding death.
  Cleaning a window takes a few seconds. But he can only work on windows which
  are closed and the residents like to look out of the window - in this case
  Willy uses a horn to chase them away. He also needs to look out for and dodge
  objects or people which fall out of higher windows. A bird likes to use
  cleaned windows as toilet and a special cleaner has to be used to deal with
  this. But it needs to be used with caution because it destroys regular
  windows."
