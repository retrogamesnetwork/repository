description: "Tommy's Plates is a shareware word puzzle game based on the vanity
  plates used on cars in the USA. The example quoted in the game's documentation
  is PPNRTYM which represents 'Peace In Our Time' with two P's representing
  Peace, N - In, R - Our and TYM representing Time. Similarly DUU12C1 represents
  'Do You Want To See One?' I the game these puzzles come with a clue such as
  these examples, again from the documentation: JMEKGNE :  Clue - A Movie Bully
  :  Answer - Jimmy Cagne ILKKSND : Clue - A Big Bully : Answer - I'll Kick
  Sand, or I'll Kick Sandy hNh : Clue - A Dairy Farmer : Answer - Half And Half
  The game is played over a series of rounds, in the preliminary rounds Players
  are given a clue and are shown two vanity plates, they must press their action
  key first, choose which plate matches the clue, then enter the word or phrase
  that the plate represents. If successful they win $100 and the chance to have
  an additional letter placed in the hard vanity plate displayed at the top of
  the screen. They then have the opportunity to guess what the hard vanity plate
  represents. The first team to win two preliminary rounds has a chance o play
  the bonus round. The single player game dispenses with the preliminary rounds
  and consists of only the bonus round. The game is entirely keyboard
  controlled. It has basic sound effects and command line switches to start the
  game with sound turned off and to force either a colour or monochrome
  display."
