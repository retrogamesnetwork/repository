description: Molefest is a single player, freeware, variant of Pipe Mania but
  instead of laying pipes to carry water the player is laying a pathway so that
  the mole can find its way home. The player cannot progress from one level to
  another until the current level has been completed. The game has sound, three
  levels of difficulty, a high score table and is mouse controlled
