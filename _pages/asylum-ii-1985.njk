description: "In this sequel to the first Asylum game, you have woken up in a
  room like a cell. In the room is a bed with a box on it. Inside the box is a
  credit card. Looking around the room you see the door open, knowing this is an
  asylum you plan to escape. Your task is to escape from the Asylum using the
  objects you find to solve the problems. Along the way though you will
  encounter the other inmates. The game is a graphical text adventure. The
  screen is split into two halves. The top half shows what you can see in front
  of you,  in the bottom is the text describing your surroundings: here you can
  type commands. Using the arrow keys you move yourself about a 3D maze. You can
  draw a map. since it is easy to get lost."
