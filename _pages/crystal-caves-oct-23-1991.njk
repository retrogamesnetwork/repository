description: "Mylo Steamwitz, an enterprising space trader, is always involved
  in one get-rich-quick scheme or another. Throughout the Crystal Caves trilogy
  he repeatedly sets out to the perilous mines of the Altairian system, hoping
  to collect enough crystals to start a profitable business. The shareware
  version only has the first episode available; the registered version consists
  of three installments, packed as separate executables. Crystal Caves is a
  side-scrolling platform game, where the objective is to finish all 16 levels,
  collecting every single crystal within. On his way, Mylo is threatened by
  numerous monsters, such as bats, robots, mine carts or dinosaurs; there are
  also a lot of hazards such as stalactites and stalagmites, pipes which leak
  harmful water or poisonous mushrooms which kill instantly. Mylo has three
  health points, and if he is harmed enough times to deplete them all, he dies
  (but thankfully he has unlimited lives). To defend himself, Mylo has a missile
  pistol, which is able to take out most enemies, but not all. Many levels
  require the player to act fast and plan beforehand, as it's easy to get Mylo
  stuck in an impossible-to-win situation - if this happens, the level must be
  restarted. Apart from the crystals, the levels contain a lot of items to
  collect: ammunition for the pistol, bonus items such as pickaxes or purple
  mushrooms that give score, and eggs which turn into letters when shot -
  collecting all 5 letters (B, O, N, U, S) on a level gives a lot of points, but
  it's not always easy to get them! It's also possible to find a power-up that
  reverses gravity when picked up, another one which gives your pistol the power
  to kill every enemy, a stop sign which freezes all enemies and makes them
  harmless and a red mushroom which allows you to kill enemies by running into
  them. These power-ups last only for a limited time though, so be careful, as
  they are always instrumental to victory!"
