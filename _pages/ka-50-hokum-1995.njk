description: In this game you are a commander of a Base Ship cruising around
  Indonesia and a pilot of four helicopters available on it. These helicopters
  are Kamov Ka-50 Hokum (assault), MIL Mi-8 Hip (assault/transport), Westland
  Lynx (anti-ship assault/transport), and Bell AH-1 Cobra (assault). You are
  planning the schedule of your missions and complete them with appropriate
  helicopter. Planning of missions is based on your previous recce flights.
  Missions vary from intercept pirate boats, escort ship through pirate waters,
  and provide air support, to unload battalion of jungle commandos, rescue
  ejected pilot, and annihilate the village. During the mission player also may
  switch back to Base Ship to plan another mission.
