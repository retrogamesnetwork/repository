description: "Little Fighter is a simple 2D brawling fighting game and the first
  game in the Little Fighter series. The player chooses one from eleven
  different characters (each with three special moves) and fights against rivals
  in small arenas. Characters have two bars: the red bar is HP and the blue bar
  holds magic points used to execute special moves. Arenas have some weapons and
  items like boxes or rocks. The game supports multiplayer up to 3 players."
