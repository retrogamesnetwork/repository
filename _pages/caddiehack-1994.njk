description: Caddiehack is shareware golf game for up to ten players, each
  player gets a different coloured ball. This game is the sequel to Caddiehack
  CGA Tour. It has been developed to use improved EGA/VGA graphics. Both games
  come with ARCH ‚Äî a course architect program that allows players to design
  their own courses. Courses developed for use with the earlier game can be used
  with Caddiehack but not vice versa. After the game setup screens, how many
  players, skill level, and sound effects to be turned on or off etc. the player
  is presented with an overhead view of the first hole. At the press of a key
  this switches to the view from the pin. There is a caddy system which
  automatically selects the appropriate club based on distance to the pin, this
  can be changed by the player to allow for hazards and weather conditions. The
  game is entirely keyboard controlled. Aiming the shot is controlled by the
  left/right arrow keys and the power of the shot is controlled by using the
  space bar to set the power meter. There is a save game feature.
