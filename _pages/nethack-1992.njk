description: NetHack is a roguelike role-playing game with both traditional
  ASCII graphics and a graphical tileset. The objective is to find the Amulet of
  Yendor and sacrifice it to your deity. In the beginning, you choose one of the
  classes - there are some traditional ones, like Priest or Knight, but also
  unusual ones like Tourist or Caveman. Then, you find yourself on the 1st level
  of the dungeon, along with your pet that will accompany you and help you in
  combat. On each level, you have to find an exit to the lower level; on the
  way, you'll find countless monsters to fight, as well as items to collect.
  Sometimes, you come upon a shop, where you can buy or sell items. Items you
  find can be blessed (more effective than normal), but sometimes are cursed
  (less effective, or outright harmful). Eating the corpses of fallen enemies is
  an important part of the game, since many creatures give you special abilities
  or immunities when eaten. While the above description might seem brief,
  NetHack is, in fact, a very complex and merciless game - there are lots of
  ways to die. Since NetHack is a roguelike, everything is represented as a
  top-down view of the current dungeon level, where the walls, the floor, and
  all items, characters and monsters are ASCII characters. More recent versions
  of the game also include an official set of graphical tiles which can be
  turned on at the player's option.
