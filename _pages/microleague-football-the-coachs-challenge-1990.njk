description: "MicroLeague Football: The Coach's Challenge is an American
  football simulation where you play as a head coach of a team. Before the game,
  you have to select the home and visiting team (both could be played by either
  human or computer), and make roster changes if you wish. During the game the
  human player can call the plays and pick the pass patterns, make substitutions
  for injuries etc. It is also possible to play a 'quick' game displaying just
  the results that could be printed."
