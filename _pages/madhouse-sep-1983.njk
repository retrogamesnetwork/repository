description: Madhouse is the seventh of Softside Magazine's Adventures of the
  Month, published for multiple systems. You have been sent to a mental asylum,
  unjustly sentenced for a crime you did not commit.  You must escape from the
  facility, and regain your freedom. NPCs suffering from a variety of mental
  health disease and delusions will interact with the player on their adventure,
  and two wandering characters have to be located and avoided.  An entire ward
  is devoted to those with the delusion they are a famous historical figure.
  There is also the "Totally Insane Ward", the "Loony Ward", and the
  Administration Ward.  Gameplay occurs over 7 days, and the player must escape
  from the asylum by the seventh day by hiding in the laundry and escaping to
  the local laundromat and freedom. All commands are via 2-word VERB NOUN
  entries, and game play contains several object puzzles. There is no save and
  restore feature.
