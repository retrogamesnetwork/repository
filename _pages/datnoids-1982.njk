description: "A game of maze navigation in text mode graphics: guide your
  vehicle from the bottom right of the screen towards the exit at the top left,
  while avoiding messy encounters with the walls.  The game consists of three
  different mazes (the first two have fixed layouts, while the third is random),
  and 10 skill levels are selectable - go higher and the action gets
  faster.  Some walls can be fired at to gain passage, but others have a
  tendency to send your missile flying right back at you. Finish one maze, and
  warp to the next one - finish all three, and you'll start over at a higher
  speed.  Considering Datnoids ' references to missiles, antimatter walls and
  hyperspeed jumps, any connection with the eponymous species of freshwater fish
  remains unclear."
