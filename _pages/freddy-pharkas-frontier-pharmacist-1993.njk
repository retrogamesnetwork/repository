description: "Freddy Pharkas was one of the fastest guns in the American West of
  the 1880's. However, in one particular gunfight with an outlaw named Kenny, he
  was outgunned and had his ear shot off. This traumatic experience caused
  Freddy to give up his pistols and enroll in the school of pharmacology.
  Blocking out the memories of his past, Freddy arrives in the town of
  Coarsegold with the dream to own and run his own pharmacy. Working with the
  town's doctor, Freddy is able to fill prescriptions, mix concoctions and
  diagnose simple symptoms. Business among the townsfolk is brisk however, the
  good times are not to last as suddenly townsfolk are run out of town and
  businesses are being foreclosed and boarded up. Freddy must deal with the
  town's problems, and discover the larger plot, or risk having a fancy shop in
  an empty town and losing all his customers. Freddy Pharkas: Frontier
  Pharmacist is a humorous point-and-click adventure game bearing many
  similarities to other Sierra titles in the same genre, in particular Leisure
  Suit Larry series. Players use the command bar at the top of the screen to
  choose a verb command that is combined with locations and objects visible to
  the player. Freddy can walk to new locations, look at particular objects,
  attempt to use objects, talk to people and enter his inventory to access items
  that have been picked up. Like other Sierra games, successful actions add to
  the player's score, judging the player on 1000 points."
