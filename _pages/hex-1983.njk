description: "Hex is a computer translation of the strategy game of the same
  name: a 11x11 grid of hexagonal cells makes up the four-sided game board; each
  of the two players (black and white) is assigned a pair of opposing
  sides.  The white player moves first, and both challengers take turns placing
  pieces on the board.  To win, either player must form an unbroken sequence of
  pieces connecting their two colored sides. Hex may be played human vs. human
  or human vs. machine, plus a demo mode which lets you watch as two machine
  opponents match wits with one another."
