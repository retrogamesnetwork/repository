description: "This unofficial DOS version shoots for a faithful reproduction of
  the Nintendo original - that is, as faithful as possible using ANSI graphics,
  but that is to be expected from an artscene group like CiA.  Here, too, the
  player sets out for the great outdoors with his loyal hunting dog, plentiful
  ammunition, and a craving for dead ducks. Of the original game modes, only
  \"Game A\" is implemented: each round consists of ten ducks that take turns
  making solo flights across the sky, one after the other, and have to be shot
  down for points.  If time or bullets run out, the duck flies away (and the
  player must suffer the hound's schadenfreude).  The flying targets get faster
  with each successive round, and fewer misses are tolerated; fail to nail
  enough of them and it's game over.  All game sounds consist of samples that
  have been lifted wholesale from the NES title."
