description: Final Assault is a mountain climbing action/simulation game. The
  object of the game is to climb to the peak of a mountain via several different
  trails of varying difficulty. Progress is made in a fashion similar to that
  used in Epyx 'games' series, with alternating joystick movements. To help out,
  you carry a backpack which you may stock with assorted items. Since there is a
  weight limit, you must choose which items you most likely will need for a
  given trail. For example, an exceptionally long trail may require camping gear
  and some additional food, where as a short trail will allow for some more
  luxuries such as extra rope.
