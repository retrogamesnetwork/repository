description: This tile-flipping puzzle game is a forerunner to the author's
  later creation, Quadromania.  The 10x10 game board is made up of tiles that
  can be cycled through 5 different states.  Clicking a tile will also modify
  the eight neighboring tiles; cells on the edge of the board, which aren't
  surrounded by eight tiles, cannot be clicked. The board is jumbled by the
  computer, and the objective is to return it to its original state (all grey
  tiles) without taking too many moves.  There are five difficulty levels, which
  determine how much vandalism is inflicted on the board at the start of the
  game - higher levels require more moves to solve.
