description: EGAWHEEL is a wheel of fortune, shareware game for one to three
  players. It was developed by Russell Mueller who later used this game as a
  basis for VGAWHEEL which uses a different graphical standard. The gameplay
  follows the format of the famous television game as it was in the autumn/fall
  of 1987 when the buying of prizes after each round was dropped from the show.
  The only major difference between this game and the show at that time is that
  the game has no bonus round. The game is played over five rounds. In each
  round the player(s) is/are presented with words which can be a phrase, a name
  or a thing. All the letters are blanked out and the players take turns in
  guessing which letters could be part of the hidden word(s). Within their turn
  a player may spin the eponymous 'Wheel of Fortune' to guess a consonant, buy a
  vowel or guess the word. If the player guesses a consonant correctly then
  their score is increased by the number of times that letter occurs multiplied
  by the amount shown on the wheel. Rounds one and two are easier because they
  have FREE SPIN segments which the player can use to retain control of the
  wheel should they guess a consonant that does not appear, later rounds are
  harder because though the values on the wheel are higher the FREE SPIN
  segments are replaced with BANKRUPT segments. This shareware game has eight
  hundred and fifty puzzles and comes an editor that allows the player to add
  their own puzzles, alternatively a puzzle disc with a further five hundred
  puzzles could be bought.
