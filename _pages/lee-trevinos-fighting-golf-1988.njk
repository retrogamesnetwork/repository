  When this golf simulation was released in 1988 the U.S. National Video Game
  Team said it was "by far the best video golf simulation available". 1 to 4
  players can tee it up on either an 18 hole American course or an 18 hole
  Japanese course.  Players 1 & 3 share controller 1 and players 2 & 4 share
  controller 2. Game modes are:

  Stroke Play - The winner has the lowest number of strokes through 18 holes.

  Nassau Game - The players compete against each other for points.  Presses are allowed.

  Practice - A single player can practice on their favorite hole.

  Swing mechanics are: Press A to start the backswing, press A at the top of the swing, press A at impact. High and low shots can be selected by pressing up or down on the control pad. Right after contact another quick press of the A button at the same time as left or right will apply backspin to the ball. Complete club selection is available with the B button. Terrain includes tee, green, fairway, out-of-bounds, water, sand (light and hard), and rough (super, light, heavy and deep). There are four available characters:

  Pretty Amy - Slow swing speed with fantastic ball control and accurate aiming.

  Big Jumbo - Powerful stroke and a long hitter but good technique is needed to control his shots.

  Super Mex - All-around player with average distance, accuracy and swing speed.

  Miracle Chosuke - Less power than Super Mex but good at putting and unequalled accuracy.  He can hit a "Reverse Miracle Putt."
