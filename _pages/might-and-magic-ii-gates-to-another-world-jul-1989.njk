description: The space traveler and rogue guardian Sheltem has left the world
  VARN, where he was pursued by the relentless Corak the Mysterious and a party
  of local adventurers helping him. The Gates to Another World eventually takes
  all of them to another world, known as CRON. There, a great turmoil is caused
  by Sheltem's actions, and the heroes must stop his madness, preventing him
  from casting the planet into its own sun. Gates to Another World is the second
  installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Secret of the Inner
  Sanctum. Core gameplay is similar to predecessor, with the player creating a
  party of six characters and exploring vast first-person 3D environments, while
  fighting enemies in turn-based combat and leveling up. Unlike the first game,
  enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though
  enemy type selection is still random. Like in the previous game, character
  classes rely each on a particular attribute to be effective. Knight, Paladin,
  Archer, Cleric, Sorcerer and Robber return, with the addition of two new
  classes, Ninja and Barbarian. Race selection features humans, elves, dwarves,
  gnomes, and half-orcs. There are several locations and items that are
  restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A new feature is the
  possibility to hire two non-player characters to travel with the party and
  participate in battles. A new skill system is introduced as well, allowing
  characters to learn such abilities as mountaineering (necessary to traverse
  mountains), linguist (for reading certain messages), cartographer (for
  creating an auto-map), and others. Compared to the first game, the sequel is
  more quest-oriented, with various characters in towns giving quests to the
  party, as opposed to purely exploration-based traveling in the predecessor.
  Time also plays a large role in this game, with some instances requiring the
  party to travel to different time periods. Characters also age as the game
  goes on; If the player waits too long, the characters' statistics will change
  to reflect their aging, and they will eventually die.
