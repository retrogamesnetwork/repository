description: Turn It II is a sequel to Turn It. In this Shanghai variant the
  player has to remove the tiles with the same marks from the board until all
  the board is completely empty. The elimination of tiles is allowed if these
  tiles are projected on the same line with no other tiles in their projection
  path. There are a certain number of same items on each level. The player can
  mark the tiles, or cancel the action to change the decision. The dead-ends
  exist if the strategy of tiles elimination was incorrect. Games are
  time-limited and a certain number of 'next move' suggestions are available
  during gameplay.
