description: Lords of Doom is a shareware fantasy role-playing game. A
  prosperous kingdom has been overrun by demons, and now a sole hero controlled
  by the player must put an end to this invasion and restore peace in the realm.
  The game uses a custom role-playing system which is based on a number of
  character attributes and skills the player can build. There are no character
  classes, and the player may develop fighting, thieving and magic skills based
  on their choice. Experience points are awarded for exploration, interaction
  with NPCs and successful combat encounters. The setting is a vast fantasy
  world with several human kingdoms, also inhabited by various fantasy
  creatures, including dragons and other monsters, as well as different types of
  undead. However, humanoid fantasy races like elves or dwarves are not present.
  The state of human civilization is comparable to that of Ancient Rome, except
  for the widespread use of magic.
