description: Interpose X-mas Greetings is a special Christmas-themed edition of
  Interpose. It features the same gameplay mechanics, but the backgrounds and
  enemies have a distinct Christmas flavour. According to the story, the evil
  scientist Atnas Sualc (an obvious case of Sdrawkcab Name) has created an army
  of robotic Santas and Reindeers, which he unleashes on the North Pole in order
  to disrupt the distribution of Christmas presents. The player's task is to
  stop the villain and this army before they reach Santa's polar home. Apart
  from the Christmas theme, the game functions similar to the shareware version
  of Interpose, including ordering information and a preview of the full game.
