description: Maximus is a single-player, shareware, empire building game set in
  the days of the Roman empire. The game documentation says that this is a
  hybrid game part war game, part trading game, part role-playing adventure. The
  player takes the role of a Roman Quaestor who runs a city and has troops under
  their command. They must trade, construct buildings, build up their power base
  and their army and conquer twenty cities bringing them into the Roman empire.
  The game is entirely keyboard controlled. It has save / load feature but no
  sound and no animated graphics.
