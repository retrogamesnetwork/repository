description: "A simple pea-shooting simulation: each round starts with a target
  positioned randomly along the bottom of the screen.  At the top left is a pea,
  ready to be launched; the goal is to find the right velocity for the shot and
  hit the target precisely, in the fewest attempts possible.  The statistics box
  keeps track of the games played so far, displays a breakdown of the results,
  and calculates your average number of shots per successful hit - naturally,
  the lower the better."
