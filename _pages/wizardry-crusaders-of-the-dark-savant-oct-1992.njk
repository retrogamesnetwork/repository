description: Crusaders of the Dark Savant is the seventh installment of the
  Wizardry series and a direct sequel to Bane of the Cosmic Forge. In the end of
  the previous game, the party of heroes finally acquired the Cosmic Forge.
  However, before they were able to decide what to do with it, it was taken away
  by a servant of the Cosmic Lords, the cyborg Aletheides. It appears that the
  Cosmic Forge was in fact a clue to the location of the Astral Dominae, the
  artifact of life, somewhere on the planet Guardia, which has now been revealed
  to the universe. The heroes then travel to Guardia, which is populated by many
  races and organizations with their own agendas, including the rhinoceros-like
  Imperial Umpani Federation and the spidery T'Rang affiliated with a malevolent
  being known as the Dark Savant, whose goal is to get rid of the Cosmic Lords.
  All these factions are looking for the Astral Dominae, finding which is the
  primary goal of the game. Depending on the decisions made by the player in the
  previous game (should he opt to import the party from there), the game will
  have different openings and begin in different locations. However, regardless
  of the initial premise, the player is free to follow or betray whatever
  faction he was supposed to be allied with. The gameplay system is very similar
  to that of its predecessor, retaining the races, the classes, the skills and
  the magic system it introduced to the series. The trademark first-person
  exploration and turn-based combat are present as well. Unlike the previous
  games, Crusaders of the Dark Savant allows the player to explore towns and
  vast forest areas between them, in addition to several large dungeons situated
  in different areas of the game world. Many NPCs have their own agendas and may
  move between locations as well, and even obtain crucial items themselves if
  the player-controlled party is not quick enough, forcing the player to change
  plans. The exotic setting contains elements of science fiction on top of the
  traditional fantasy background. Like in the previous game, encounters, events,
  as well as the heroes' reflections upon them are described through text
  messages. A few skills have been added, including swimming and climbing, as
  well as diplomacy. The latter reflects the more important role dialogues and
  interaction with NPCs play in the game compared to the previous installments
  of the series. A mapping skill has been added, which, if learned, displays -
  for the first time in the computer releases of Wizardry games - an automap on
  top of the exploration screen. Skills are increased with repeated usage and
  the characters now receive separate bonus points for each category (weapon,
  physical, and academia). Like before, magic is divided into four schools
  (Psionics, Alchemy, Theology, and Thaumaturgy) and six elemental categories.
