description: Sequel to the 1990 bestseller game Team Yankee. While using the
  same split screen interface as the predecessor, the game now features an
  enhanced graphics engine, showing the game world much more detailed as it has
  been shown in Team Yankee. The game is still a mixture of a realistic tank
  simulation and a strategy wargame. Whereas the predecessor uses the story from
  the book, this game's story is fictional. A Soviet communist has occupied the
  Yama Yama Isles in the South Pacific which are an important strategic base in
  this area. You'll have to regain control of the islands in five missions.
