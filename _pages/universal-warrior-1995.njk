description: Universal Warrior (or The Machines, as is the official title of the
  PC version) is a top-down maze shooter in the vein of Gauntlet and Alien
  Breed, with added economic elements. The game alternates between equipment
  management and the actual in-level action, in which a remote-controlled  robot
  runs through maze-like maps and shoots mechanical enemies. With the money
  earned in these sci-fi contests, improved equipment can  be bought in five
  categories, making the robot more powerful, more maneuverable and less easy to
  damage. On the other hand, getting damaged means you must spend money on
  repairs. This encourages careful and effective playing. The game can be played
  solo, competitively in two-player hot-seat mode or cooperatively in
  split-screen mode. The Amiga and the PC version of the game have the same
  basic design, but entirely different levels. For a comprehensive list of
  differences between the versions see the trivia section.
