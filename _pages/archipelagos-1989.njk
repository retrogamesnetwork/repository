description: "Archipelagos is a real-time puzzle and strategy game with an
  unconventional premise and equally unconventional gameplay. In the future, man
  carelessly poisons the earth with nuclear waste. The polar ice caps have
  melted, turning the surface of the earth into many islands of decaying land
  masses, known as Archipelagos. Man then built systems to try to clean up the
  pollution, but these failed. The only life left were genetically-altered
  plants made in an effort to clean up the waste -- these also turned hostile.
  It is up to you to clean up the earth, island by island. Controlling a
  hoversphere, it is up to you to make Earth's many islands of land habitable.
  To do this, you need to knock out the radiation generators on each island,
  which can be done by knocking out each generator's power sources (there are
  several per island). Once these are knocked out, you have 90 seconds to get
  back to the generator and disable it before it melts down, taking you with it.
  Obstacles, unfortunately for you, are plentiful: You can't knock out a power
  source unless it is connected by a \"land bridge\" to the generator. You have
  the ability to create land where needed, but this takes up energy, and you
  have a limited supply. Also a hindrance are the many genetically-altered
  entities left behind on the islands: Viral trees that poison the ground;
  necromancers (former hoverspheres) that now erode land instead of creating it;
  eco eggs that explode on touch; and aircleaners, who are ruthlessly efficient
  in cleaning up the air -- and everything else, including you. The entire game
  plays from a 3D first-person viewpoint. A movable cursor selects where to move
  or what to manipulate. There are 10,000 islands on Earth to purify. If you can
  make it past Archipelago #100, you are then free to select any of them."
