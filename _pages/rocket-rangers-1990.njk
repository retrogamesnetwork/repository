description: "Another variation on the classic Spacewar! style of interstellar
  combat, played against a human player or the computer: two triangular
  spacecraft duke it out for survival, with the simple premise of
  kill-or-be-killed.  The ships roam freely across the arena, using rotate and
  thrust controls to manipulate their movement; edge wrap-around can be toggled
  on or off, and an optional gravity well may be placed at the center, with or
  without a sun (crashing into one is highly ill-advised). Victory is achieved
  by destroying the opponent ship's hull.  Both players are equipped with a
  shield, which protects the hull until it can be taken down, and a regenerating
  energy storage which is depleted by thrusting, firing, or using a special
  ability: the powerful disruptor (which launches a sphere of heavy damage at
  short range), the tractor beam (which pulls the two ships together) or the
  hyperspace teleporter (which displaces the ship to a random location).  Taking
  heavy damage can disrupt or disable some of the ship's controls, so fly safe."
