description: What is the game called? Amaze!  What's in it? A maze! Now that
  we've got that taken care of... Due to unexplained factors, our protagonist, a
  roguelike yellow happy face, has found him or herself stranded in the middle
  of large, multi-segmented textmode labyrinth (each segment coincidentally
  about the size of one metric computer screen, decorated with a different
  colour scheme and using different characters as obstacles), filled with
  endlessly re-spawning enemies (red faces), finite ammunition refills, health
  bonuses and abstract dangers only hinted at through the use of arcane ASCII
  symbols one can't even name.  Sometimes messages spelled out plainly in the
  room layout address the player directly.  The enemies carry on their own
  routine in realtime, Kroz-style, so the hero may as well move along at a brisk
  pace in search of the maze's exit... supposing that there even is one. The
  game was later (but not too much longer -- same year of release) gussied up
  with extra flashes and bleeps and a new introductory scroller and distributed
  in crippled shareware form as Insanity, boasting new, unfamiliar messages
  among the traditional map lay-outs, and hinting at adventure-game
  puzzle-solving through the inclusion of new objects in the maps.  Since this
  version boots the player after a single death, it is difficult to track
  further changes.
