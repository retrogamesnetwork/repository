  Dragcity U.S.A. is a single-player, shareware, drag racing game where the
  objective is to achieve the fastest time possible in a drag race. The game is
  mouse or keyboard controlled and there's not much sound other that a base
  thrumming when the car accelerates. Game play is simple and basically consists
  of trundling up to the start line, waiting until the green light shows, then
  accelerating through the gears as fast as possible and continuing the
  acceleration through to the finish line. Within a couple of runs for practice
  each race takes around eleven seconds or less.

  The game keeps a record of the best time of each session but there's no high score table and the race time from one session is not held over to the next. To improve the race time the player can tinker with the car's gear ratios.
