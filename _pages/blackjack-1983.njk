description: "Yet another early conversion of the classic casino game, based on
  a previous version written for the Compucolor II.  The computer deals, using a
  standard deck, and the player attempts to rack up cash by beating the dealer's
  hands: the hand closest to a sum of 21 wins; exceed 21 and you bust; if both
  player and dealer have the same total it's a push, and neither side wins. As
  per usual, each side receives one card at a time and decides whether to hit,
  stand, double down, or split; if the dealer's first card is an ace, the player
  is offered an insurance bet.  The house rules: $500 is the maximum bet, and
  blackjack pays 1.5 to 1."
