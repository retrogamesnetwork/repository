description: "Flyswat, as the descriptive title conveys, simulates an everyday
  activity that's decidedly less fun than what's usually associated with games:
  the annoyance of being pestered by a housefly while sitting in your easy chair
  and trying to read a book!  Seeking to end the distraction, you pull out your
  trusty flyswat and attempt to flatten the buzzing little
  pain-in-the-butt.  This is done by moving a cursor across the screen, getting
  within swatting distance of the fly, and hitting space to do the grisly deed;
  the difficulty level determines how fast and unpredictable the fly will
  get.  When you finally splatter the pest, you'll be scored by the time and
  number of swats it took you.  Then you can continue your literary pursuits -
  no doubt feeling a little less irritated, and a little more bad-ass."
