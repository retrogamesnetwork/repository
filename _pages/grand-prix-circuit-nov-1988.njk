description: Formula One racing is recreated in detail in this simulation. You
  have the choice to drive a Ferrari 187/88C, a McLaren MP4/4 or a Williams
  FW12, each with different qualities. Rival drivers also have their own styles
  and strengths, and to win the World Championship you will have to master
  these. Pitstop timing and planning is crucial as well, although only tires are
  changed in late-1980s F1. You can choose whether to drive a single race at
  Brazil, Britain, Monaco, (Western) Germany [Hockenheim], Canada, Italy,
  Detroit and Japan [Suzuka] or to drive a full championship on every track.
  Every Race includes a qualifying round. The graphics in the game are
  sprite-based.
