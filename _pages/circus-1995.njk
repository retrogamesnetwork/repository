description: Circus is an educational game for children of 6-8 ages, getting
  familiar with the basics of digits (from 1 to 10) and arithmetic operations
  (compare, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). This process
  is achieved by animated questions asked by the circus performers, while the
  player selects the answers in digits, ranging from 1 to 10. Juggling and
  goalkeeper arcade games are also present for fun.
