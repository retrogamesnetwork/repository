description: You are a gravedigger called Samuel, and you've heard of the famed
  Loodam Crypts and all the riches they contain. The game is a top down
  action/puzzle game quite similar to Paganitzu. Your goal is to collect as many
  jewels as possible, while avoiding monsters and traps, and then search for the
  exit. You have a shovel which can be used to kill weak enemies and can find
  stronger ones as the game progresses. Most levels have a puzzle solution that
  requires setting combinations of switches in the correct order and finding
  keys.
