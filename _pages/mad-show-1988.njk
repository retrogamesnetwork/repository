description: "Up to six players may compete in this bizarre, futuristic game
  show presented on the screen of a TV set (wooden finish and all).  Each turn
  starts with a spin of the wheel: win the bet, and you score - lose, and you
  participate in a contest of your choice... to the death. The contests are at
  least slightly deranged, if not downright mad: first there's Mad Space, which
  challenges you to a lightsaber duel on a floating space rock. Next up is the
  Mad Machine, where you chase a tiny robot around a room full of mechanical
  traps, and try to whack it on the head with a metal shield. Mad Tunnel is a
  frisbee-style game - like Discs of Tron, if it were played with sawblades and
  rockets over a pool of mutated alligators. Finally, Mad Virus tosses you back
  and forth on a conveyor belt (through cages of hungry mutants) while you try
  to destroy the gigantic brain that controls it."
