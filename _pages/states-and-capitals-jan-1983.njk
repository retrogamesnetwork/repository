description: An educational geography quiz game that, as heavily implied by its
  name, tests players on their knowledge of states and capitals within the
  USA.  A map of the country is shown, complete with state borders, and on each
  turn a random state is highlighted.  Depending on the chosen game mode, the
  player then has to input either the state's name, or its capital's
  name.  After a series of ten questions, the player is scored according to the
  percentage of correct answers.
