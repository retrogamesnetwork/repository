description: '1994Pool+ is a billiard (cue sports) game. The game offers
  eighteen different selectable "weapons" via buttons across the top of the
  screen: eight different Side/English, Follow & Draw settings and one for the
  center of the cue ball and nine different vector/point selection type
  settings. There are also enemies which will destroy your cue ball if you allow
  it to come into contact with them. Enemies include a spinning fireball, a
  helicopter, a UFO, a bomb, a dragon and cheerleaders! The full/registered
  version of the game offers 5 differently shaped tables: a traditional
  rectangular shaped table, an elongated hexagonal shaped table, a quadrilateral
  parallelogram shaped table, a triangle shaped table and a differently shaped
  hexagonal table. The shareware version, 1994Pool, offers only the first two
  tables.'
