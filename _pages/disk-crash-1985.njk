description: The object of Disk Crash is to guide the unlikely protagonist, a
  floppy disk (of the actually-floppy variety!), from the bottom of the screen
  to the top by traversing a series of floors.  The flexible storage device can
  cross one floor at a time; when it arrives at the opposite end, it climbs up
  to the next one and must travel across in the opposite direction.  Trouble is,
  the playfield is plagued by a gang of horseshoe magnets that bounce up and
  down at varying speeds.  Each passage must be carefully timed and executed, as
  any collision with a magnet spells terminal data corruption for our plastic
  jacket clad hero.
