description: "Windoze is a variation on Columns which pokes fun at Microsoft's
  popular operating system, as evidenced by its use of the fashionable Usenet
  epithet for that OS at the time. The familiar colored blocks are replaced with
  various icons from Windows 3.x, which descend from above in groups of three
  and pile down at the bottom. The triplets can be moved, flipped and rotated as
  they fall, and points are scored by forming rows, columns or diagonals of 3 or
  more identical icons, thus removing them from the pile. The action speeds up
  as it goes on, and every 1000 points a special \"wildcard\" block appears:
  touch it down on an icon, and its matching brethren will all be wiped out in
  one fell swoop. The source code, written in XPL0 (a Pascal variant) and
  assembly, is included. Despite its looks, Windoze is a DOS game - as the
  author states, \"it does not require Microsoft's version of Windows, since it
  has more than a sufficient quantity of icons on its own.\""
