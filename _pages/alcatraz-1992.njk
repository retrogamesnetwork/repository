description: "A drug baron took over Alcatraz prison and now the player takes
  the role of an U.S. Navy Seal to break in and neutralize him. He has two hours
  to complete his objectives in three buildings and needs to survive two
  different playing styles: side-scrolling fighting on the streets and
  first-person shooting inside. Outside, the goal is to reach the building in
  which the objectives have to be completed. Of course the baron's thugs are not
  too pleased and try to kill the hero - so he has to shoot back with a many
  different weapons, e.g. flamethrowers, machine guns, bombs, and other
  destructive or close combat weapons, which can be collected from dead enemies.
  Similarly to Hostage: Rescue Mission, he can also hide in the background in
  certain spots. Once inside a building, the game switches to a first-person
  view, in which the player has to navigate a maze to reach his goal, e.g.
  recovering evidence. To his disposal are a radar and a rifle."
