description: "Certain versions of the Microsoft Mouse driver for DOS came
  bundled with a game called Boa (included alongside such utilities as
  Paintbrush and Mouse Menus). Boa takes the familiar premise of Snake games and
  turns it on its tail: the player is now the food, trying its best not to be
  consumed by an always-moving, ever-growing snake. Our hero - a mouse - is
  controlled, as one might expect, with the mouse.  The only objective is to
  survive as long as possible without being captured by the computer-controlled
  boa constrictor, which twists across the playfield in pursuit of its prey -
  touching the snake's body, or the walls, means death.  The boa will get
  hungrier with time, and speed up as it tries to add you to its menu;
  fortunately enough, it is possible to temporarily freeze time to escape a
  tight spot.  For every 500 points, the slavering serpent can be magically cut
  down to size and forced to start over."
