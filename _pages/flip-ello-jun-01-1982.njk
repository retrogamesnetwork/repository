description: "FLIP-ELLO is an early IBM PC conversion of Othello/Reversi, and as
  such it faithfully keeps to the established rules of the classic board game:
  each player chooses a color - black or white, represented here by \"X\"s and
  \"O\"s respectively.  Initially two chips of each color are placed at the
  center of the 8x8 grid, then the players take turns placing additional chips,
  attempting to capture the opponent's chips and flipping them over to the
  player's color: this is done by enclosing a sequence (vertical, horizontal or
  diagonal) between two chips of one‚Äôs own color. When no more moves can be
  made, whoever has more chips on the board gets the game. In this adaptation,
  it is possible to ask for hints (whether any moves remain, or which of the
  possible moves is best); players may also switch sides in mid-game, as a
  potential extra challenge to whoever's currently in the lead.  If any side
  runs out of pieces, one may be \"borrowed\" from the opponent.  The game is
  playable against another human or against the computer, which tends to
  accompany its moves with gleeful taunts and jeers."
