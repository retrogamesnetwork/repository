description: Bob Winner is searching for a lost civilisation somewhere in the
  desert, and has to gain three keys to access it by beating a boss in Paris,
  London, and New York respectively. The first two bosses are boxers, the last
  one is a gun-toting cowboy. The items necessary to beat the bosses are found
  on the preceding screens. Bob Winner is a side-view flip-screen action game
  with hand-to-hand combat sequences. The protagonist will often have to avoid
  rolling barrels and flying insects that try to impede his progress.
