description: "Bomber is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up where the player
  flies a B-29 bomber and must destroy three heavily guarded enemy bases. On
  each level the player must make it through enemy lines to the base which is
  always 200 kilometers away, the remaining distance indicated in the corner of
  the screen. The plane can move left and right, as well as accelerate and
  decelerate. The bomber is equipped with two types of weapons: a cannon to
  destroy aircraft, and bombs to destroy ground targets such as bunkers and
  tanks. A red crosshair indicates the location at which the dropped bomb will
  explode. The player has three lives, and a bonus life is awarded for every
  10,000 points."
