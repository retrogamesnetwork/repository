description: MaxMan is a single player, shareware, Pac-Man clone. As with other
  Pac-Man games the player runs around a maze, eating power ups, and generally
  avoiding the nasty green gremlins unless they have eaten a big power up in
  which case they go monster hunting. This game adds a minor twist in that when
  the player loses a life their ghost lives on as a 'grim reaper' and becomes
  one of the nasties that has to be killed. The higher the player's score when
  all the gremlins and ghosts have been killed the more baddies they will face
  in the next round. The game is keyboard controlled and has basic sound effects
  such as bleeps, whistles and so-on.
