description: Monuments of Mars is a low-rez, early PC platform game sharing an
  engine with Apogee 's Arctic Adventure and Pharaoh's Tomb. A number of
  astronauts sent to Mars on a mission to explore the strange structures there
  have mysteriously gone missing. Now NASA sends its best man (you) to rescue
  them and, if possible, find out more about the mysterious monuments and their
  purpose. This perilous journey will take the player to the famous Pyramid,
  Fortress and Face of Mars, among other locations. Along the way he will
  collect various items and face deadly alien creatures. The game is split into
  four episodes, the first one, First Contact, was distributed free as shareware
  but the remainder The Pyramid, The Fortress, and The Face had to be purchased
  from Apogee. Each contains twenty puzzle-filled levels, each of which is one
  screen large. The game is entirely keyboard controlled but offers the
  player(s) a choice of action key settings.
