description: GameTek's home version of the classic game show The Price is Right.
  Bob Barker and the Beauties are not present, but a multitude of pricing games
  from the show, as well as the wheel and the showcase, have been faithfully
  replicated. Four (or a maximum of eight, counting both rounds - the programme
  suggests switching players) contestants can play, with the computer filling in
  for the rest. Whether bidding on Contestant's Row or playing a pricing game,
  contestants will attempt to closely guess the price of an item provided. All
  items in the game are often-unintentionally-humorous misspellings of
  recognizable brand names, to avoid trademark infringement. Pricing games
  include the Mountain Climbing (in which your 3 guesses must be less than $300
  away in total, otherwise a goat will push you over the edge), Safe Cracking
  (in which you have 3 possibilities for each part of the price, and must
  correctly guess it) and the Dice Game (in which you accept or reject random
  rolls to get the real price). There is a persistent Hall of Fame with winners
  and their scores, and a parser for guessing/bidding prices. Players have to
  type in their price guesses, and answer to the math of how "off" they were, as
  they would if they were on the show.
