description: "Ruckus Poker is a card game simulation published as Volume Sixteen
  in the popular Coffee Break series. Four poker varieties are available: 5 Card
  Stud, 7 Card Stud, Chicago, and Hold 'Em. You can select one of them or just
  play a random game. There are three computer-controlled opponents to be chosen
  out of eight players with different bios and personalities. Two of them,
  sitting in front of you, are shown animated and will share their optional
  thoughts from time to time. On-line help is available, including the tutor who
  could be asked for a suggestion, as well as statistical tracking of every play
  with percentages of winning and losing hands."
