description: In Archery, the player is challenged to get an arrow as near the
  bullseye of a moving target, which descends from the top of the screen, as
  possible. The player gets three tries from each of five different starting
  positions. More points are awarded for shots that land nearer the center, and
  the highest total score at the end of the game wins. Archery may be played
  alone, against the computer, or against a second player.
