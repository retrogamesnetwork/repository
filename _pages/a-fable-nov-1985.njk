description: A Fable is a short work of interactive fiction that involves
  wandering through a series of vignettes from a person's life, like a maze of
  memories. The author noted in 1995 that the game was not complete, only "a
  sketch" created to help test an interactive fiction authoring system, not
  intended for public release.
