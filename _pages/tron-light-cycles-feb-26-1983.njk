description: In yet another game inspired by the famous movie scene, two (human)
  players challenge each other to a reckless match of light cycling -- guiding
  their vehicles throughout the top-down playfield while trying not to plow into
  the surrounding walls, or into the trails that their light-cycles leave
  behind.  In this particular version, both belligerents are beset by big blocky
  boxes that clutter the arena; each round brings a new and random arrangement
  of these obstacles, which our cyclists would be wise to avoid. Other than
  changing directions at will, the players may accelerate or decelerate to
  control their speed of movement.  Crashing into anything ends the round and
  awards a single point to the opponent, and the first player to reach a score
  of ten gets the game.
