description: As Lemmings spawned its annual Holiday Lemmings specials, so too
  the Lemmings parody Lamers yielded this festive spin-off.  Following the
  Lamers premise of AI-controlled Lemming-like Lamers (here dressed in Santa
  suits) securing their own safe passage through a hostile landscape toward a
  computer for them to muck up, the task before the player is to use all tools
  available to thwart them. With more seasonal hazards to employ than the
  conventional arms featured in its predecessor, here the player deploys limited
  amounts of Christmas toys and cruel factors of the winter weather -- snowballs
  and buckets of ice water.  Will nothing drive away these Lamers?
