description: "Cadaver is an isometric 3D arcade adventure, played using a
  joystick and keys. In the person of the thief Karadoc, the player sets out to
  raid the five stories of the castle Wulf. Legend has it that it‚Äôs filled with
  treasure. What the legend didn‚Äôt say is that the Castle is also filled with
  deadly traps, riddles and monsters. Surviving is not only a question of
  defending your life. Karadoc needs to explore the murky dungeons and eerie
  corridors to prove his wit in collecting and interacting with objects, putting
  them to the right use, mastering spells and solving tasks posed by the gods.
  Quick reflexes and jumping skill wouldn‚Äôt hurt either. The ultimate objective
  is to kill the necromancer, Dianos. Karadoc's basic skills include the ability
  to walk, jump, climb stairs and fight monsters. There are three major modes of
  controlling the dwarf and his actions: basic movement, interacting with
  objects via icons and the rucksack."
