description: TiltMaze is a single player game based on those annoying puzzles in
  which the player must herd lots of balls into the centre of a maze In this
  implementation the maze is tilted via the arrow keys and the small balls of
  the real game are replaced with smiley yellow faces, the object being to get
  all the faces into the central area. At various points within the maze there
  are traps that destroy some of the smileys thus preventing the player from
  achieving a maximum score. The game is entirely keyboard controlled and has
  basic sound effects, a beep when a smiley falls into a trap
