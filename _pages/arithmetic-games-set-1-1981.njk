description: "A pair of games, Beano and Rockets, played against the machine or
  a second human player.  The common concept is how moves are made: each side
  rolls the dice, and puts together a mathematical expression from the rolled
  numbers. The four basic arithmetic operators (plus parentheses) are allowed,
  and the result determines the move. Beano is a variation on bingo: each side
  gets a 5x5 card composed of randomly arranged numbers. If a move can be made
  that matches a number on the card, a bean is placed on that number. The first
  player to fill a row, column, or diagonal with beans wins the game (cells
  marked \"free\" always count as filled). Rockets arms both players with ships,
  randomly placed on a 15x15 board. The moving player must specify a valid
  number of spaces to go (as above), and a direction.  When the ship is done
  moving, it fires four rockets - straight up, down, left and right - destroying
  the rival ship if it hits. The winner is the first player to take down 5 of
  the opponent's ships."
