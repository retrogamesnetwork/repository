description: "A jail break has occurred in the city of Megatropolis and five
  evil supervillains have escaped. The city's last resort is to summon a team of
  superheroes, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and special abilities.
  The gameplay is similar to the Apogee EGA titles, like Duke Nukem and Cosmo's
  Cosmic Adventure: Forbidden Planet. There is a grand total of 50 levels to
  play and 7 characters to choose from. Gems can be collected in the levels to
  upgrade characters' stats, and fruit can be collected to increase health."
