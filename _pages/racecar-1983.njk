description: If you've ever felt like challenging your IBM to a race, look no
  further than Race Car to get your speed thrills in 40-column ASCII
  graphics.  The action takes place on a figure-8 race track, where one player
  competes for a single lap against the computer, represented by a smiling face
  (the computer holds the title of champion, which explains the mirth). Your car
  steers and turns automatically -- the only controls are speeding up and
  braking.  Turning corners at unsafe speeds may result in a crash, which can
  set you back valuable time.  The first to cross the finish line wins the race;
  3 difficulty levels are available, plus a demonstration mode for those who
  prefer the role of spectators.
