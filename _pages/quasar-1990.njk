description: "Perhaps notable for a valiant effort at real-time, wireframe 3-D
  graphics in (Tandy 1000) BASIC, Quasar is a first-person space shooter taking
  place across multiple quadrants of an unnamed galactic sector.  Your fighter
  is equipped with limited energy stores, and a double laser (which depletes
  said energy). You start off in a planetary sector populated by waves of
  hostiles, which come in two chief variants: yellow and red; both take pleasure
  in ramming you, with bad results for your continuing existence. Destroying the
  red craft increases your energy however, while picking off the yellows engages
  your warp drive.  In this mode, zapping a red will launch you into a stargate:
  this abstract geometric zone will lead you to another quadrant, depending on
  your warp factor - it may again contain a planet, or an empty void patrolled
  by enemy saucers.  It may also be occupied by a black hole (where your
  discomfort will be short-lived, but so will your game)."
