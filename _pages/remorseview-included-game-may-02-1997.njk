description: "A text mode implementation of Pac-Man was hidden in the
  RemorseView application included in the program's art packs and intended to
  facilitate viewing of their ASCII artwork. To recap the gameplay basics, in a
  nutshell, the player gets a side-on view of characters in a top-down maze: the
  yellow gobbling mouth is controlled by the player and its goal is to eat (by
  moving on to them using keyboard directions) all of the power pellets located
  on the map. Also on the board are wandering ghosts, who will usually kill
  Pac-Man if they come into contact with him or with power pills in the corners,
  which temporarily turn the ghosts blue and vulnerable. This version does not
  include elements such as the fruit bonuses."
