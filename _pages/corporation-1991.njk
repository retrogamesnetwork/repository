description: A first person shooter that requires you to think things through
  rather than just attack anything that moves.  This game preceded Wolfenstein
  3D by a number of years, and while the walls were not ray cast, but solid fill
  polygons, it was still one of the earliest simulations to tackle a human
  viewpoint with complete, 360 degree freedom of movement.
