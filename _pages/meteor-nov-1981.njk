description: "A simple \"character graphics arcade game\" which puts the player
  in charge of an ASCII smiley face.  The objective: erase the solid blocks and
  avoid getting splattered by falling meteors.  Points are scored by consuming
  the 3 rectangular target blocks, or the trails left by the meteors as they
  streak across the screen; for each block hit by a meteor, you lose a point
  instead.  The difficulty level determines the location of the blocks: the
  higher it is, the closer they are to the top of the screen where the meteors
  are spawned. Meteor! was created as an experiment by the author to test the
  capabilities of his university's then-new IBM PCs, which came without the
  optional color graphics or joysticks, and see if an arcade-like game could be
  written in BASIC despite those shortcomings.  This version was later
  republished in Creative Computing Magazine.  The PC/Blue series of
  shareware/freeware compilation disks included a modified version of the game;
  here, the difficulty level increases as you progress, and every 1000 points
  the blocks are automatically redrawn higher up the screen."
