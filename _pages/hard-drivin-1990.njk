description: "Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in
  control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the
  course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit
  a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the
  road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be
  careful when you pass... The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt
  track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt
  track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving
  through a loop, and so on. Crashing the car has no serious consequences and
  indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash
  head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the
  bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is \"reset\"
  and you get up to speed again. The home conversions retain most of the
  then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade
  version."
