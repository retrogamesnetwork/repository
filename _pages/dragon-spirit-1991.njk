description: "Princess Alicia of the kingdom of Mitgult is kidnapped by the
  monster Zawell. It's now up to the heroic warrior Amul to transform himself
  into a blue dragon and go and rescue the princess. Dragon Spirit is
  a  vertically scrolling shoot-em-up which consists of nine stages. Players fly
  around and destroy everything in their path.  Much like in Xevious, action
  takes place on two planes, both in the sky (where the dragon is flying) and on
  the ground.  The dragon has two different kind of attacks: fire that shoots up
  the screen, and fire that drops to hit a place on the ground in front of the
  dragon.  Enemies exist both in the air and on the ground, and some can fly up
  from the ground to the sky. Players can pick up power-ups, or upgrades, that
  will help them in their fight.  Upgrades can include extra heads on the
  dragon, health, faster shots, and more. At the end of each stage is a boss
  that needs to be defeated. Having good upgrades that are not lost from being
  hit before reaching the bosses will help. The NES version is unique in that it
  presents a somewhat altered story and an additional gameplay
  mode.  Technically, it is a sort of sequel, with \"A New Legend\" being its
  subtitle.  In this version, Zawell is already defeated and King Amul and his
  now wife Queen Alicia, have two children named Iris (a princess) and Lace (a
  prince). A new evil named Galda has decided to attack the Earth. Galda also
  has taken Iris captive and now Lace must go rescue her. The NES version also
  adds a new initial stage.  If the player survives it, the game continues in a
  \"Blue Dragon\" game much like the original arcade game.  If the player fails
  to clear this initial stage in one life, an easy mode called \"Gold Dragon\"
  begins, skipping about half the game's stages, giving the player extra hit
  points, and features a different ending. Also of note, the TurboGrafx-16
  version's seventh and eighth stage are different than the other versions. The
  underwater and dark themed stages were changed to castle interior themed
  stages."
