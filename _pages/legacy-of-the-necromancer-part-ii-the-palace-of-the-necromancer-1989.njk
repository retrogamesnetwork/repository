description: "After finishing part I, the player received a map which leads to a
  palace full of treasure. However, this is no ordinary palace: it once belonged
  to an evil necromancer who tried taking over the world 150 years ago. In front
  of the palace, the wizard Vandard appears who has an important task for the
  player: finding something inside the palace which can defeat the sorcerer
  Mirvos who took over the Necromancer's tower. In order to win the game, the
  player needs to solve puzzles by collecting items (the inventory can hold six)
  and entering commands into the parser. It supports most commands and
  abbreviations found in Zork. Like in those classic adventure games, the player
  can die and render the game unwinnable with certain moves. Resource management
  includes thirst, hunger, air (when underwater) and lamp power. This game is
  second part of the Legacy of the Necromancer series. Although all three parts
  were released simultaneously and share the same gameplay mechanics, they could
  be purchased and played individually."
