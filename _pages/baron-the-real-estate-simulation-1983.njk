description: "As with Blue Chip's other business simulation games, the objective
  in Baron is to get filthy rich by speculating and trading - this time around,
  in the American real estate market.  The game is turn-based: each turn
  represents one month of market activities, and allows you to eyeball the
  market trends, get the lowdown on various properties, buy/sell them, trade in
  options and and take out loans.  You start out with $35,000 in cash and the
  status of Novice, which carries some limitations like lower loans and high
  closing costs on sales.  As you increase your net worth, becoming an Investor
  or a Banker, the limitations relax and you gain better leverage. The goal is
  to achieve the status of Baron by piling up a net worth of $1,000,000 within
  60 months, but if you pull that off, you may still opt to go for the next
  million and see how quick you can get there.  On the other hand, a lack of
  business savvy may leave you bankrupt.  Up to 14 players may record their
  status and history, although only one can play at a time.  A single game
  session may be saved to disk and resumed later."
