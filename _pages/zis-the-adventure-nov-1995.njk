description: Zis the Adventure is a Korean-made colorful platformer starring a
  young boy named Zis who finds a letter sealed in a bottle and travels to the
  magical land Lisnia to rescue its inhabitants from evil pirates. The
  protagonist's default weapon is a slingshot that can hit targets from afar.
  Watermelons scattered through the stages award the hero with various costumes
  when shot at, each costume granting him a unique weapon. These special weapons
  include a yo-yo that can kill an enemy in one hit; a magician outfit that
  allows the boy to knock on his hat to release a swarm of birds; stars that act
  like homing missiles, etc. Diamonds and candy can be collected to increase
  Zis' health (represented by hearts), which carries over to the next stage.
  Many stages introduce diverse challenges, the recurrent one being collecting
  keys to open doors, which is featured in several stages. In some stages the
  boy can also float in the air for a short while with a little umbrella and can
  attach ropes to upper platforms and climb on them. There are also slides, hats
  that propel the boy to otherwise inaccessible platforms, pencils that draw
  platforms when activated, floating cushions, and other special objects.
  Setpieces include a scrolling shoot-em-up level and a stage where Zis rides a
  dolphin. The game consists of six "worlds" that the player must complete in a
  linear fashion, each encompassing three stages. There are no boss battles in
  the game. There is no possibility to save the player's progress; however,
  unless the player quits the game, he or she can opt to replay any already
  completed stage with an unlimited number of continues even after the
  protagonist runs out of all his lives.
