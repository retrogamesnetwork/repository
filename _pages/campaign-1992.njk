description: "Campaign covers some of the most important battles of the Second
  World War, from Sahara to the Russian campaign, and from the Battle of the
  Bulge to D-Day. A map editor allowing users to modify existing scenarios or to
  create new ones is included. You can take involvement at many levels of a
  battle. You can take direct control of either driving or gunning a tank,
  direct groups of 16 tanks and their support units, and create a combined
  overall strategy factoring in supply routes. Over 150 different vehicles from
  both sides are featured. It's a hard-core wargame that will like mostly to the
  \"aficionados\" of the genre. The game package includes a lot of extras: a
  thick \"Equipment factfinder\" manual (170 pages), 2 huge posters, replicas of
  WW2 postcards and of a newspaper."
