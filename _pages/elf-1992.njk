description: Cornelius the Elf was living peacefully in a forest with his
  sweetheart Elisa. However, an evil creature known as Necrilous the
  Not-Very-Nice kidnapped Elisa and disappeared with her. Cornelius must embark
  on a perilous journey to rescue the love of his life. Elf is a platform action
  game with light adventure elements. Cornelius is armed with a ring that fires
  projectiles at enemies. During the course of the game he can collect herbs and
  animals (called "pets"), which can be traded in shops for upgrades such as
  stronger attacks, extra speed, magic spells, or devices such as a flying
  machine. In addition, certain segments require the player to communicate with
  NPCs populating the game world and fulfill their requests, usually by
  obtaining specific items for them. The game keeps track of the player
  character's behavior, assigning the player a rating and affecting the ending
  scene depending on the protagonist's actions, which mainly involve killing or
  sparing the lives of the game's non-hostile characters. The protagonist's
  health is measured in hearts and lives, which can be replenished or increased.
  The player can save the game between stages.
