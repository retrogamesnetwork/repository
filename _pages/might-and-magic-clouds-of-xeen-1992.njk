description: The evasive guardian Sheltem has once again escaped from relentless
  Corak and the six heroes of Terra who were helping him. The brave adventurers
  tried to pursue him on his journey through space, but were unable to reach the
  destination. Meanwhile, the distant world of Xeen is experiencing new
  troubles. A mysterious villain known as Lord Xeen has imprisoned Crodo, the
  local oversees, and is plotting to execute control over the land. A band of
  local adventurers becomes involved in the conflict and get to the bottom of
  the mystery. Clouds of Xeen is the fourth installment in the Might and Magic
  series, and a follow-up to Isles of Terra. It utilizes the same graphics and
  interface as its predecessor, and is generally very similar to it in structure
  and gameplay. Among new features is the possibility to keep notes recording
  quests and important locations in the game, a separate inventory section for
  quest items, and two difficulty levels. All over the game's world there are
  pyramids which work as teleporters as soon as part five of the series,
  Darkside of Xeen is installed. The two games can be played simultaneously,
  merging into World of Xeen, which includes multiple cross-over quests in both
  installments.
