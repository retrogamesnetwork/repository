description: "Fire Hawk: Thexder - The Second Contact is the sequel to Thexder.
  The Fire Hawk robot has the same main design as Thexder: a laser, shield and
  the ability to transform into a jet. It's also possible to use some special
  weapons which can be found during the missions, such as the Flasher, (damages
  anything on screen) and the Stopper (freezes enemies for a while). Levels are
  divided into sub-levels, with each fourth one featuring a boss fight. Some of
  the main improvements compared to the original game include the ability to
  save a game at certain points, the ability to switch between special weapons
  during gameplay, and a greatly expanded high-quality soundtrack."
