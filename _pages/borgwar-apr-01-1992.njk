description: Borgwar is a single player space shooter. The player takes the role
  of Captain Jean-Luc Picard in command of the starship Enterprise NCC-1701-D.
  The ship sits at the bottom of the screen and is moved left/right by the arrow
  keys. A huge Borg cube appears in the top left of the screen and it is the
  player's job to destroy it. To do this they have forward firing torpedoes,
  only three of which can be on-screen at a time, and phasers which are aimed
  via the J, K, I & M keys. The Borg ship does not fire back, it just descends
  down the screen very slowly and very deliberately until it corners and absorbs
  the Enterprise.
