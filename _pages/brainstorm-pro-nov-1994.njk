description: BrainStorm Pro is a single player, shareware, puzzle game. The
  player is shown a screen which contains blocks with coloured arrows on them.
  The objective is to line these up so that all blocks of the same colour are
  touching, when this happens the blocks disappear, when all blocks disappear
  the level is complete. This being a puzzle game there are obstacles to be
  overcome such as tiles which change the direction of gravity. There are twenty
  levels in the shareware version of the game and one hundred and seventy levels
  in the registered version. On completion of a level the player is given a
  password so that they can restart future gaming sessions at the next level.
  The game has music and is entirely mouse controlled.
