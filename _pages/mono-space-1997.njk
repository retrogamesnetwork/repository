description: "Mono Space is a scrolling shoot-'em-up that fuses the play style
  of Gradius with the wire-frame aesthetics of Asteroids, sending the player
  across the voids of space and through hordes of death dealing aliens, all
  presented in stark black-and-white.  The action proceeds from left to the
  right, as in most horizontal shooters (with some degree of vertical scrolling
  possible); the player's ship is equipped with a forward-firing blaster and a
  special missile weapon. The entire game consists of a single level, broken
  down into stages by a series of checkpoints. Out of the various types of enemy
  craft, bizarre geometrical shapes and (yes) asteroids that patrol the star
  lanes, some will drop power-ups when destroyed: one kind adds to the player's
  missile stock, and the other increases the ship's power.  Raising the power
  gauge beefs up the ship, multiplies its standard guns and adds to its armor.
  Written in QBasic, Mono Space uses a handful of strategically-placed assembly
  language routines to improve performance and overcome some of the interpreted
  language's limitations."
