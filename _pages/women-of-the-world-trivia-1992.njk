description: Women of the World Trivia is a shareware, or "try before you buy",
  quiz game for up to four players. This is a 'Trivia Shell' game meaning that
  the basic software can be applied to many different subjects by changing the
  load screen and question packs. The game has three levels of difficulty which
  it applies to the same question pack. For example given the question "Who was
  the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in 1976?" on the Beginner
  setting the player would be given the answer and True/False buttons; on the
  Intermediate setting the player would be given four choices; and on the
  Advanced setting the player would have to type in the complete answer. With
  multiplayer games it is possible to have players on different difficulty
  settings - useful when parents are playing against children for example. The
  game has a hint feature and a high score table that shows the top five scores
  for each difficulty setting. If the player answers five correct questions in a
  row they are rewarded with a bonus question. Games can be configured to be any
  length, the default is thirty questions, and can be restricted to particular
  topics. There is an optional hint feature. The shareware game has just 105
  questions while the registered games have either three hundred or six hundred
  questions.
