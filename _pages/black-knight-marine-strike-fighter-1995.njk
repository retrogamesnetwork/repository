description: Black Knight is an air combat F/A-18 Hornet flight simulator. It
  features 50 different combat missions, 8 training missions as well as a free
  flight mode. A built-in mission creator is also available. Features included a
  flight instructor mode which offered instructions at every key point of flight
  or combat; flight recorder to play back your flight viewed from various
  angles; and digitized engine and cockpit sounds from actual F/A-18 Hornets. It
  was initially distributed in 1995 as a shareware demo with some functions
  disabled.
