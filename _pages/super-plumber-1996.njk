  aside, goomba-smasher -- no platform game this, instead it's a textmode
  implementation of the solid gold (copper and lead might make more sense)
  puzzler Pipe Mania.  What that means is that you are given a series of
  differently-shaped pipe segments, and have to lay them down to form a sequence
  on a 10x10 grid so as to ensure the longest continuous fluid flow through
  them. Unlike Pipe Mania, tiles can't be replaced with others once they have
  been placed, however you can exterminate the active tile by pressing K.
  Scoring is 25 points per square used, with 50 for using the second side of a
  cross.
