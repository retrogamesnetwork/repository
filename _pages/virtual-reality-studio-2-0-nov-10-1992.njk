description: As you would expect, "Virtual Reality Studio 2.0" (VRS2) is
  "Virtual Reality Studio" (VRS) with enhancements.  There are double the number
  of controls and commands available in VRS for added complexity and
  flexibility.  You can now create transparent objects or objects that
  fade.  Rounded objects such as flexicubes and spheres are now
  possible.  There's a sound effects editor so that your virtual creations need
  no longer be silent and the program now comes with a library of pre-designed
  3D "clipart" for those of you who are too lazy to design everything from
  scratch. Like the original VRS, the program comes packaged with a tutorial on
  VHS video cassette for those who don't like to read manuals and your VR
  creations can be saved as stand-alone programs that don't need VRS2 to run.
