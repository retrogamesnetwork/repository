description: Bunny Blast is a single player, freeware, shooter. The game is very
  simple which is understandable as it was written as a learning exercise.
  Basically the game is Whac-A-Mole. Pink rabbits appear from the bottom of the
  screen and the player uses the mouse to shoot them. There are seven levels all
  with different names and identical game play.
