description: "After having recovered the three treasures, King Graham has been
  crowned king. Now having needing a queen for companionship, Graham searches
  the land for a maiden, but to no avail, so he turns to the magic mirror for
  help. The mirror shows him a beautiful girl locked away in a quartz tower in a
  faraway land of Kolyma, and must find three keys that are used to unlock the
  door that will lead to her. King's Quest II: Romancing the Throne is a graphic
  adventure game. As is typical for Sierra's AGI games, players move Graham
  around with arrow keys and perform actions by typing commands in the
  interface, which are usually combination of verbs and nouns. The game is
  similar to its predecessor in structure and gameplay system. Like Daventry,
  Kolyma is a large cyclical world consisting of interconnected screens.
  Compared to the first game, it is bigger and busier, with more locations and
  places of interest.  Puzzles follow a similar format; knowledge of fairy tales
  is advisable for solving some of them, and complex solutions grant the player
  more points than a brute force approach possible in some cases."
