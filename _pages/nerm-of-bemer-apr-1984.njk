description: "A Compute! Magazine type-in BASIC title featuring Nerm the Worm,
  who is trapped in Bemer Castle and would like nothing more than to escape (and
  consume a generous helping of \"magic mushrooms\" along the way).  Yet another
  variation on Snake where the player controls a serpentine crawler in perpetual
  motion, which must be guided to consume food, dodge deadly walls, and avoid
  biting its own tail. The castle is composed of eleven rooms, each trickier to
  navigate than the last.  In a vaguely Carrollian manner, the rooms are prone
  to sprouting mushrooms which cause Nerm to grow as he eats them: after
  consuming five mushrooms, the exit doors will open, leading to the next
  room.  Extra lives are awarded along the way, presumably another effect of the
  magical fungi.  When the game is over, a verbal ranking is given based on the
  player's progress, ranging from \"zero\" to \"hall of fame\"."
