description: Heavy Barrel is a shooter with a top-down view similar to Commando
  and Ikari Warriors. Terrorists have seized the underground control complex of
  a nuclear missile site. It is up to the player to infiltrate the installation
  and eliminate the leader of the terrorist army before they can launch the
  missiles. To stop the terrorists you will need the powerful weapon Heavy
  Barrel. The problem is that the weapon still is in the installation. Before
  the fortress fell the weapon was taken apart and locked in six different
  storage lockers. To defeat the terrorists you must collect all keys and
  reassemble the weapon. The game supports co-op for two players.
