description: "Similar in concept to the later (and better known) Incredible
  Machine series, Creative Contraptions is all about creating silly machines
  from wacky parts to accomplish even wackier tasks. The puzzles consist of Rube
  Goldberg contraptions with wrong or missing parts, and the player must figure
  out the correct replacements - from basic devices such as pulleys and ramps to
  absurd objects like elephants, cannons and boxing gloves. Three game modes are
  available: in the first, you pick a goal for your contraption, and your job is
  to fill in the basic mechanisms; the second puts you in charge of the \"Zany
  Objects\". The real challenge lies in third mode (Contraption Mix-Up), which
  takes you through a sequence of puzzles, complete with a time limit and a
  scoring system - the fewer mistakes you make, the more points you earn.  Each
  sub-game can be played in two difficulty levels, and there's also a tutorial
  which explains (and demonstrates) how the basic mechanisms work."
