description: "Fun School 4: for the under 5s is an educational game part of the
  Fun School series with this version aimed at the under fives. There are six
  games and activities that allows the child to spend the day with Teddy and
  each activity has varying skill levels. The six activities are: Teddy's House:
  Teddy's house is being painted but the painters don't know which colours to
  use so the child decides which colour to use for various parts of the house.
  After the painting is completed the child then has to tell the computer what
  colour certain objects are before being told a colour and what object to
  paint. Fun Train: Teddy is at the fun fair in the park and the child has to
  decide if a picture matches the picture on the train as well as words matching
  pictures. Teddy Paint: This activity allows the child to use a simple art
  package to draw pictures with. Teddy's Book's: It is time for bed and Teddy is
  having a sleep over with his friends. Daddy Ted is reading them a book from a
  shelf over the bed. The child has to decide which book Daddy is reading from
  the gap in the books on the shelf. Teddy's Karaoke: This activity allows the
  child to sing various nursery rhymes from a choice of songs. The child can
  hear the song with the words on the screen. A bouncing ball bounces in time on
  the words to help the child follow the song. Addition: Teddy is at school and
  has to do additions from the blackboard. The child is presented with a number
  of objects and the child has to say how many. Other skill levels has the child
  adding the objects before the pictures are removed and just the sum appears."
