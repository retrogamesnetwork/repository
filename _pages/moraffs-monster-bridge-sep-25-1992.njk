description: Moraff's Monster Bridge is a single-player card game, with a
  setting in the Moraff's World universe. The player is depicted as a human
  adventurer who has entered a tavern in an RPG called Moraff's World, and
  joined in a game of Monster Bridge. The cards and rules are not quite
  ordinary, there are 96 cards in six suites with various monsters depicted on
  them, sixteen cards to each suite. You have one seat at a table for four
  players, with your human hands seen at the bottom and the other three players
  appendages shown as tentacles. You play to win your own bid, the minimum size
  of the bid depends on how many times you trade cards from the dealer at the
  outset. There is a trump suite selected each round, and you must follow suit
  if you can, otherwise you can use any card. You get eight cards per deal. If
  you win the required bid, you gain points, otherwise you lose points. The
  winner is the player who first gains 75 points in the game. There are quite a
  number of screen settings available, this was one of the common features found
  in many of Moraff's DOS games.
