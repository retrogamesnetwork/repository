description: RAM! is a simulation of combat using Triremes. Triremes were the
  war ships used in ancient Greece. The game takes place during the
  Peloponnesian War, which was a conflict between Athens and Sparta. These boats
  were meant to ram and sink the others using oar power. RAM! is based on the
  board game Trireme (also by Avalon Hill).
