description: "In robotfindskitten, the name is the game: You are robot, and you
  have to find kitten. Sounds simple. Problems start with the fact that there
  are other objects which are not kitten! Even worse: You don't know which
  objects are kitten and which are not! The only way to differentiate them both
  is touching. If you touch a non-kitten, you get some quirky phrase, otherwise:
  robotfindskitten! The game is a mindless yet meditative and (due to its
  idiosyncratic humour) quite fun lo-fi adventure-oid with some similarities to
  roguelikes (all-ASCII, single player, top-down randomized dungeon) and others
  to Progress Quest. It also comes with an impressive base of platforms, having
  been ported to over 20 systems, encompassing old and new, consoles and home
  computers. Particularly interesting is the OpenGL 3D Windows version aptly
  named robotfindskitten3d."
