description: "Empire is a turn based strategy game. Originally conceived as a
  board game the game was too complex and found new life as a computer game. The
  game plays on  a 60x100 map. Players use their armies to try to conquer all of
  the tiles in play. Armies are produced in cities which are then used to
  conquer additional cities. Originally developed for the PDP-10 Mainframe, the
  game was later ported to the Heathkit H11 and IBM PCjr after which it was
  picked up by a publisher and received a graphical overhaul as Empire: Wargame
  of the Century."
