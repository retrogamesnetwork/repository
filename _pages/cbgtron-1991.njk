  Cbgtron is a shareware, two player game that is inspired by the light-cycle
  race in the film TRON. The players start in the centre of the game arena
  heading in different directions. As they drive around the arena they leave
  drive around the game area leaving a solid trail behind them. The object of
  the game is to cause other players to crash into one of these trails or the
  edge of the game area. The first player to win the required number of rounds,
  the default is ten, wins the game.

  In some matches the arena has solid walls while in others there are gateways this making it harder to trap an opponent. The game is entirely keyboard controlled, uses character graphics and has sound effects. The game allows the players to alter the action keys used to steer the light cycles, the number of games needed to win a match, the game speed, and to play with/without borders.
