description: You are the last living member of your ninja clan after they were
  brutally slaughtered. Now, you seek to exact revenge on the evil shogun
  responsible. The Last Ninja is an action/adventure game set in medieval Japan.
  The game is shown in isometric view, and the eponymous ninja can walk in four
  directions, jump, fight the enemies and collect necessary items on his way.
  While fighting, the ninja can use several different blows and block. There are
  a couple of weapons to find, including smoke bombs and shuriken.
