description: "ALF, a furry alien who for fear of discovery can't really leave
  the house, is Vision Software's choice to teach children about the wide range
  of geographical features found in the United States. Lesson one: A multiple
  choice quiz to test knowledge of geographical terminology.  Hosted by ALF, who
  fires a cannon (!) containing your answer choice at a bucket. Lesson two: ALF
  quizzes you on the names and/or capitals of states highlighted on a map of the
  48 contiguous states (the packaging claims this lesson covers all 50.) Lesson
  three: ALF now quizzes you on landmarks' locations. Lesson four: a simple
  timeline of the admission of states into the union. Lesson five: Allows
  children to make a personalized print-out of events with historical and
  personal relevance."
