  You are Arthur Dent, an Englishman with a bad hangover wearing a dressing gown
  containing a much needed buffered analgesic and some fluff.  Your house has
  just been destroyed, followed shortly thereafter by your planet Earth (mostly
  harmless).  You’ve been rescued by your friend Ford Prefect, who’s not
  actually an out-of-work actor.  He has given you a book (The Hitchhiker’s
  Guide to the Galaxy), a towel, and is now telling you to put a fish in your
  ear.  It must be a Thursday; you’ve never quite gotten the hang of Thursdays.
  The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is written by Douglas Adams and Steven
  Meretzky and based on Adams’ BBC radio series, television series, and the
  series of subsequent novelizations.  It’s one of the classic Interactive
  Fiction games produced by Infocom, labeled as Science Fiction and has a
  Standard Level of Difficulty.  Though divergent from the source material, the
  main characters, locations, and concepts are here.  Unlike the book, death can
  come quickly if Arthur fails to observe his surroundings, collect inventory,
  talk to people, and consult the Guide.  DON’T PANIC! Original C=64 Grey Box
