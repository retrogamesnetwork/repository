description: "The Amulet is set in the fantasy land Osbeorht which is in the
  grasp of the demon wizard Eoghan and a brotherhood of necromancers. However, a
  brave adventurer starts on a journey to set things right. In order to defeat
  evil, he needs to travel through Osbeorht and find a number of artifacts which
  are said to be crafted by Prince Beorth, ruler in more pleasant times: an
  amulet, six power stones and a helm. After choosing one of five classes (which
  only influence strengths and weaknesses), the player starts the journey on the
  one-screen map of Osbeorth. In each turn, the player moves one field and
  either encounters nothing, finds treasure or a monster. The latter initiates
  combat (unless the player surprises the monster and chooses to avoid it) which
  is basically a sequence of dice rolls. When the player attacks, there is a
  choice between using the sword (aiming for the head, body or limbs) or a
  spell. Each monster has two statistics (combat strength and psy power) which
  should influence the player's choice - a monster without psy power only laughs
  at spells. Delaying the choice too long results in a missed turn. The player
  and the monster exchange hits until one of them dies; when the player wins
  experience points are awarded. More powerful spells are available after
  earning enough experience. Otherwise there are also special places to visit on
  the map: there is a safe way without monster encounters as well as so-called
  secondary scenarios, e.g. a swamp or the necromancers' castle. Entering them
  opens up a new map to explore. There are also two friendly castles on the main
  map which allow to save the game. The game calculates a rating based on found
  treasure and earned experience."
