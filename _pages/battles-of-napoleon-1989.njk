description: Battles of Napoleon is a historical wargame that lets you play
  either side in four of Napoleon's famous battles -- Auerstadt, Borodino,
  Quatre Bras, and the infamous Waterloo. Additionally, the game features a
  detailed scenario construction set that will allow you to design your own
  battles; everything from maps, to troop types, to weapon ranges and damage.
  Gameplay is turn-based, each turn consisting of different phases. During your
  turn, you can establish various objectives (map squares to occupy) for each
  unit or commander, move commanders between units, move a unit, change
  formation, and, of course, attack or retreat. The Borodino scenario is the
  smallest, and can be used as a "tutorial" of sorts before moving on to the
  larger, more complex scenarios. This is a game that fans can legitimately
  spend several hours on. The construction set allows, as you might expect, the
  creation of new scenarios for the game. In it, you will find the standard map
  and unit editors -- however, SSI allows you to make changes down to the weapon
  and unit type. This allows you to create scenarios for virtually any type of
  battle you can think of. As a silly example, it is possible to take the stock
  weapon "musket", change the damage and range, and rename it "laser rifle" --
  you then have the makings of a futuristic battle on your hands. (Of course,
  you would need to modify just about everything else to complete such a
  scenario... but you get the idea.) The learning curve for this game is steep;
  it is probably not for the faint of heart. Anyone who enjoys getting
  shoulder-deep into battlefield strategy and tactics, though, will feel very
  comfortable with this game.
