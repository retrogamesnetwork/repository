  series and it has about 30 pictures featuring Latin letters. Each picture
  includes the letter in upper-case and lower-case, and items which begins from
  this letter or include it within (for example, on " Aa" picture A pples lie on
  the ground, A irplain flies, certain person moves out the g a rb a ge c a n
  with the c a p on his he a d, etc.) with famous characters from Sesame Street
  to color. Pictures could be colored from a palette of 16 colors. A mix button
  would "mix" the current color with the 15 other colors and give a total of 256
  colors. Choosing a color and clicking in the picture do a color fill in the
  area clicked. The finished, or in progress, coloring was automatically saved
  to disk. Player may also remove all colors applied previously to start
  coloring from the very beginning. Pictures could be printed with or without a
  monthly calendar, description, or message.
