description: "Jason Youngblood is a young cadet MechWarrior stationed on the
  Citadel of Pacifica in the Lyran Commonwealth. Jason is training hard to
  become a battle mech pilot, following his renowned father Jeremiah. One day,
  the Citadel is attacked by the forces of the Draconis Combine from a
  neighboring star system. Barely escaping, Jason teams up with a member of
  Crescent Hawks, a special unit established by Jeremiah. Together, they must
  find the other members, ready to face the new threat. This will be harder for
  Jason than for anyone else, for he is sure that his father was among the
  attackers... BattleTech: The Crescent Hawk's Inception is a role-playing game
  based on the BattleTech franchise. The first part of the game is spent
  training in the Citadel, acquiring the game's currency and experience, and
  learning how to fight in battle mechs or on foot, using smaller weapons.
  Afterwards, the game follows a more traditional RPG structure: Jason explores
  Pacifica, visiting its cities, recruiting companions, and fighting enemies in
  turn-based combat."
