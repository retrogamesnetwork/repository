description: Dodgem is a shareware, single-player game in which the player
  navigates their spaceship over the surface of a planet avoiding some obstacles
  and collecting others. The story to the game is that as a space miner the
  player has discovered a planet rich in the ore of a precious metal, Orindum.
  The only way to mine it is to skim to the surface which means some nifty
  flying is needed to avoid 'mysterious natural barriers'. The game has seven
  levels and in each the player must collect five pieces of ore, i.e. crash
  through the yellow blocks while avoiding all others. The game can be
  controlled by keyboard, joystick, or mouse.
