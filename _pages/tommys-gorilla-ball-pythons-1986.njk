description: Tommy's Gorilla Ball Pythons is a single-player DOS game. The
  player controls a gun which fires alternately up, left, down and right. This
  is automatic, the game is not about firing as fast as possible, it's about
  strategy and making sure each shot counts. The gun will not fire while the
  previous shot is still on screen and a shot, once fired, will travel to the
  edge of the screen wiping everything in its path. Pythons spring from various
  points around the edge of the screen. These grow inwards towards the player
  who starts in the centre of the screen. The objective of the game is to attain
  as high a score as possible by shooting pythons. A shot passing through the
  body of the snake will make a hole and score points but a shot that hits the
  snake in the head will stop it growing. The game has nine levels of difficulty
  and records the top ten scores for each difficulty level.
