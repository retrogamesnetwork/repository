description: Cartel$ & Cutthroat$ is notable for being one of the first business
  sims in existence. 1-8 players compete for profit in this simulation of
  cut-throat competition that is a simulation of the basic tenets in finance and
  economics.  Understanding these concepts is key to winning the game, which
  involving setting your production level and price where marginal costs equal
  marginal revenues, borrow funds when prime rates are low to expand, and
  minimize cost per unit. You must also pay careful attention to the state of
  the economy and consumers' tastes, both of which change constantly. If you're
  unsure of what to do, your advisor in the game will guide you in the right
  direction.
