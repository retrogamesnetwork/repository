description: "Hoosier City is a top-down action game in 3 episodes. You must rid
  a city of evil mutants in a post-nuclear-war era. You can move from screen to
  screen to collect keys and objects in order to move on. You can collect
  weapons and money to buy weapons: you start with only a sword, but in the end
  you will have machine guns and bombs."
