description: Shadow Ape is a point-and-click adventure game. You play as a five
  year old boy who enters a mysterious house to find the mythical shadow ape
  that no one thinks really exists. You have three commands at your disposal -
  do, take and use - which you can use in combination with items you find in the
  house. The screen is divided into different sections. There's a visual part
  where the environment is shown, buttons for directions and items, the command
  buttons, and a large part where the description of the environment or feedback
  on actions is written in text.
