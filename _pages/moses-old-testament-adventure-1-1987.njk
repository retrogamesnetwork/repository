description: In this Christian adventure game, you assume the role of Moses, who
  must free his people, the Israelites, from slavery in Egypt.  A text
  adventure, with optional graphics.  Follows the book of Exodus very closely,
  and the "hint" feature usually directs you to read a particular passage.  The
  game itself is quite short and relatively easy, with much of the important
  parts of the story presented as several screens of non-interactive text.  Many
  of the early "puzzles" involve addressing places or people by
  name.  Unintentionally funny at times.
