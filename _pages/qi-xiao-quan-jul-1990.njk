description: Qi Xiao Quan is a Taiwanese-made action game based on the Japanese
  manga Ranma ¬Ω. The protagonist is a teenager named Ranma who fell into a
  cursed spring, which causes him to turn into a girl whenever he touches water.
  There are two modes in the game, which are essentially two different games in
  one. The "Normal" mode involves exploring a labyrinthine first-person
  pseudo-3D dungeon, occasionally participating in side-scrolling one-on-one
  fights, during which Ranma can jump, punch, and kick the opponent. Other
  events include encountering characters from the manga or game developers,
  answering trivia questions, or playing rock-paper-scissors with a panda who
  also happens to be Ranma's father. The "Special" mode is a side-scrolling
  action game with light platforming elements. In this mode, Ranma traverses
  linear stages and shoots small fireballs at enemies. He can also charge to
  perform a more powerful attack. Each stage ends with a boss battle.The player
  controls Ranma in his male incarnation in both modes.
