description: "A maze navigation game which places more emphasis on nimble
  fingers and quick reaction than on finding the way out.  The challenge is to
  avoid touching the walls: the player starts with 100 points, and controls a
  marker which must be guided towards the exit point; five skill settings
  determine the speed of the action.  Each bump against the maze walls will
  deduct a point, and when finished, the player's performance is ranked
  according to the remaining score.  The game's 10 levels may be played
  separately, or in succession - for an extra challenge, the multi-level maze
  carries the score from one level to the next."
