description: 2160.  Beam technology, energy shields, and ground-skimming
  propulsion systems have revolutionized ground combat into high-speed,
  wide-ranging battles. World powers like the Pacific Combine and the European
  League spar and vie for territory with Grav tanks, striders, and
  Leviathans.  Take the role of a commander overseeing one of these skirmishes
  and match your tactical wits with the computer or another player. Firezone
  translates pen-and-paper, tactical wargaming to the computer screen.  Your
  primary view is a hex battle map with up to seven different types of terrain,
  showing stacks of infantry, artillery, armor, and command bases.    There is a
  structured turn sequence, with players alternating movement, fire, and
  retaliation.  The game stretches beyond a table-top wargame by allowing hidden
  units and providing a map-editor with which to create your own scenarios (nine
  are included).
