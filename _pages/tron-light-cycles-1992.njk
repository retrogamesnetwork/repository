description: Based off the Disney movie TRON, this game attempts to recreate the
  light cycle game. Two colors face off in the attempt to box in and ultimately
  crash the other opponent using "Light Trails" that spring up behind each
  machine. A store randomly appears in which you can buy upgrades to your light
  trail and various devices to hinder your opponent. You can play against
  another player or the computer.
