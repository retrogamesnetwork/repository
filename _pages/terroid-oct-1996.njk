description: Terroid is a single person, top down, sideways scrolling,
  shareware, space shooter. The game plays much like R-Type and S.W.I.V. which
  is as the makers intended, with the player facing wave after wave of alien
  craft while flying over missile firing ground installations and collecting
  power-ups. It can be played via a joystick or the keyboard and has sound
  effects and music. The story behind the game is the generic tale of a lone
  starfighter returning from patrol to find their home planet destroyed and that
  the population have been teleported to the alien homeworld as slaves. Only
  you, that lone pilot, can free them. The full game has nine levels plus two 3D
  bonus levels, one comes after level three and the other after level six, in
  which the player has to fly their ship through a series of silver rings while
  avoiding space mines. The objective is simply to achieve a high score, there
  are three levels of difficulty Beginner, Easy and Normal with the player
  scoring more points on the harder settings. These games have fixed levels
  which contain minefields, barriers and traps. There is also a Training game
  mode which plays an endless game with "an intelligent level generator' which
  creates attack waves to fight against, these levels do not have the traps and
  challenges of the standard games Terroid has no save game option but,
  unusually, if the player has lost their three lives and has a score in excess
  of 50,000 they are offered the option of buying three extra lives in exchange
  for points.
