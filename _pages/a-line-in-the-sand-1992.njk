description: A Line the Sand is a conversion of the board war game by TSR of the
  same name. It depicts a variety of conflicts in the Middle East, including the
  Gulf War and hypothetical conflicts involving nations like Iran, Israel and
  Saudi Arabia. Gameplay is turn-based, with each side being able to deploy a
  variety of land, air and sea units. Each side can be played by either a human
  or a computer player. In addition to the basic mode, in which only military
  forces are used, there is also a diplomatic mode where players have to make a
  variety of diplomatic decisions in order to reach certain goals.
