description: "This catch-the-falling-objects game uses almost the entire
  keyboard for its controls.  An assortment of ASCII characters is raining down
  from the sky, and your job is to catch as many as you can: each column of the
  screen is marked by a letter or a number, and you can instantly move your
  basket to any position on the floor by pressing the corresponding key.  The
  various symbols have different point values, but you're only allowed 21
  misses, so they're all equally important to catch. The game can be played in
  40 or 80-column modes, and offers four difficulty levels.  When the game is
  over, you're awarded with a short interlude from the speaker, depending on
  your score - and if you were good enough, the computer will adjust for your
  skill by making each level twice as difficult!"
