description: Search and Destroy is a WWII-era naval simulator featuring a series
  of marine missions, all with the goal of defending groups of friendly ships
  from enemy sub attacks. Each mission takes the player aboard a Fletcher-class
  destroyer into a different area, viewed using a zoomable map, where an enemy
  submarine must be located according to sighting reports received over the
  radio. The destroyer is armed with a limited supply of depth charges to
  dispatch the attacker, using the sonar (with its two selectable range
  settings) and depth indicator to intercept. Enemy subs fight back with
  torpedoes, and all damage to the destroyer can be monitored and controlled,
  using pumps, flood controls and automated repair. If the attacker is
  successfully eliminated, the player's performance is evaluated and s/he may
  earn a promotion - and possibly a medal (for outstanding achievements). On the
  other hand, characters may be killed in action, or even demoted for desertion
  if a mission is aborted early. The destroyers are modeled and named after real
  historical ships, and the game offers several features such as mission replay
  (letting you watch through the previous engagement with the enemy sub
  visible), a Sea Trials (practice) mode, and the Hall of Valor which records
  the history and statistics for every character created.
