description: Day Of Pigs is a shareware vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up game in
  a space setting. Steering a fighter craft, the player needs to fight
  continuous waves of enemy ships, dodge their fire, and pick up powerups. A
  typical level ends with a boss battle. The plot of the game concerns an
  artificially created race of intelligent pigs that is sent to destroy a planet
  called Quenzar which houses rich consumers of pork. The player character is
  tasked with stopping the pig fleet. Day Of Pigs features single player mode
  only. The ship is controlled entirely with the mouse. There are no sound
  effects or music in this game.
