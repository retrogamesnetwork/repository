description: A pack of activities for kids ages 3 to 7 placed in the African
  Serengeti (well, sort of). The game comes with 5 different simple puzzle games
  that exercise shape/pattern recognition skills, plus an "Explore Story" where
  you lead Maya, the young lion cub, back to her mother; and a "Hide and Seek"
  adventure where you try to find several animals by observing their behavior,
  etc. Also included is a Parent's Guide with suggested activities and
  complementary material including photographs of every animal in the game, and
  background info of Africa.
