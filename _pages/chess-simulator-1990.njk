description: "Chess Simulator is a chess game which offers the standard
  features: playing chess against the AI which can be set in a number of
  different levels suited for beginners and advanced players (the maximum ELO
  rating is 2150); optionally with an advice option which tries to teach chess
  to the player. Graphical features include a number of different pieces and the
  option to change the angle and zoom of the 3D playfield. Of course it is also
  possible to use a top-down perspective. The game also provides a way to
  calculate the user's ELO score: the program presents 24 situations and the
  player must provide likely moves within two minutes."
