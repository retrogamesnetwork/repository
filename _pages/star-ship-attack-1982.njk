description: "Your peaceful colony out in space was just minding its own
  business, when it suddenly came under attack by a marauding, cross-shaped
  alien vessel.  This unrelenting foe seems to have its eyes (and its lasers!)
  on the colony food stores, which must be protected at all costs; your only
  defense is a single ship, armed with a random number of torpedoes. The invader
  can fire its lasers in four directions simultaneously - your shields can
  absorb one hit, but a second one is immediately fatal.  There are numerous
  ways to win the fight: a well-placed torpedo shot, a successful boarding (if
  you can get close enough), or just staying alive until the enemy wanders
  off.  On the other hand, if your ship is shot down, the food stations are
  destroyed, or even if you ditch your mission and wander off the screen
  yourself, the colony is kaput."
