description: Fly your chopper and complete various missions in this simple
  helicopter simulation game. You create your own pilot, and as you complete
  missions successfully, your pilot gets promotions, and the game goes on until
  either the pilot gets killed in action, or gets promoted all the way to
  General, thus retiring the pilot. To start a mission, you select your pilot
  and choose your difficulty. Each difficulty has its own group of missions, and
  the mission in your choice of difficulty is randomly selected each time. The
  objective in a mission can be destroying an enemy aircraft or building,
  delivering something to another friendly base, stopping a cruise missile, or
  just destroying all the buildings in the enemy territory. If you get killed in
  a mission, then your pilot is permanently dead, and your only option is to
  create a new pilot or use a different one. If you complete a mission without
  dying, however, you get points, and if you have enough points, you get
  promoted to a higher rank. Basically, you beat the game by completing missions
  without getting killed until you're finally promoted to General, which is when
  your pilot retires. All the missions take place in one world, where there is
  one allied base on each end (you'll start at either of them), and enemy
  territory filled with buildings and aircraft in the middle. The gameplay is
  non-linear (aside from mission assignments), and allows you to go wherever you
  want and complete the mission in any way you choose. Even after you
  successfully complete your assignment in a mission, you can still fly around
  and do stuff like explore, or destroy other enemy buildings and warcraft, with
  the mission only ending when you land back at the base you started at (or the
  other base). Your helicopter is equipped with bombs, nukes and missiles. You
  can fire the bombs straight at objects, or drop them below you. Nukes are more
  powerful, and are more effective at destroying things. Missiles are also
  relatively powerful, and fly fast and straight. All your ammo is limited,
  however, and you can reload any time by landing at one of the allied bases.
