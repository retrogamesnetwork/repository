description: "Target is a simple game of marksmanship: as a series of hostile
  starships zoom nonchalantly across the screen, you attempt to get them within
  your crosshairs, so you can proceed to fry them with your trusty pair of
  lasers.  You'll face off against five such enemies, and each one will take a
  somewhat different flight path; the four available skill levels determine the
  speed of the action.  When you've had your five attempts, you will be verbally
  rewarded - or abused - based on your rate of success."
