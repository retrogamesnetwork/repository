description: Bert's African Animals is a single player, shareware, colouring
  game for young children. This game offers the child the opportunity to create
  pictures using pre-drawn templates and figures. As each animal is selected its
  name is displayed in big letters and a voice says its name. The animals come
  in four different sizes  and are dragged into position with the mouse at which
  point they can be coloured. The game also has a Story function to caption
  their pictures, a save/load function and a print function. When registering
  this program purchasers could choose to buy one or more of the following image
  files Bert's Christmas, Bert's Dinosaurs, Bert's Prehistoric Animals, or
  Bert's Whales and Dolphins.
