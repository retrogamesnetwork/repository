  Diamond Dash is a Lode Runner clone with 25 levels. As an original, it is a
  game of ladders, ropes, enemies, and diamonds, played on multiple levels
  sequentially. The player controls a highly trained commando sent to an
  underground warehouse to reclaim stolen diamonds. The player must pick up all
  the diamonds in each level to progress to the next level. Each level is
  heavily guarded. The guards have no weapons, but if one of them touches the
  protagonist, one of his lives will be taken away. Commando's only weapon is a
  portable proton accelerator that allows him to blast large holes in the floor
  which the guards (and he) can fall into. The holes will "heal" after a certain
  amount of time. If a guard is in a hole when it heals, he will reappear at the
  top of the screen. If the commando is in a hole when it heals, he is dead. The
  commando has 5 lives at the beginning of the game. He gains 1 life for each
  level he completes. The guards can pick up diamonds. They will drop the
  diamonds when they fall into a hole. If no diamonds are left on the screen,
  and the ladder to the next level has not appeared, then 

  one or more of the guards is (are) carrying diamonds.
