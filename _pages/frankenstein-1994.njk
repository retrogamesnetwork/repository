description: Frankenstein is a timed side-scrolling platform game. As Egor
  Woodenhead the player must collect all the body parts and screws needed to
  create infamous Frankenstein's Monster. The game area is divided into four
  locations - village, cemetery, dungeon and the castle - full of hostile
  peasants and animals. Contact with the enemies means a loss of energy, same as
  touching ground spikes and falling from high. They can be killed by jumping on
  their's heads. Egor may carry up two items at a time and supplement his energy
  by the contact with a blond haired woman walking through the village.
