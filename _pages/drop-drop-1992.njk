description: Drop-Drop is a puzzle arcade game, probably inspired by Tetris and
  Columns. There is a rectangular playfield. Various blocks appear slowly from
  the top. If one of the columns would reach the bottom, the game is over. The
  player has a cursor at the bottom which can be used to select a particular
  column, pull blocks into that cursor the bottom, move the cursor to a
  different column and push the blocks back to the top. Multiple blocks can be
  moved at once, but they have to be the same type. As soon as the column of at
  least 5 blocks of the same type gathers together, this group annihilates,
  freeing up space on the playfield, thus making it possible to continue the
  game.
