description: "This version of the well-known dice game was originally written
  for the Compucolor II; up to 5 players can participate (one of them may be the
  computer).  The objective is to score points by creating various combinations
  on each roll of the five dice.  After the first roll, any number of dice can
  be rolled again to achieve a desirable set.  The upper sets (1 through 6) are
  scored by summing up the dice with the respective numbers, and the lower sets
  contain various combinations: three/four of a kind, full house, small/large
  straights, chance (sum of all dice) and Yahtzee (five of a kind). A particular
  combination may be played only once per game, but this version differs in that
  multiple Yahtzees are possible - giving increased scores and a bonus turn at
  the end of the game."
