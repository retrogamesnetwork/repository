description: Bubble Crack is a variant of Bust-A-Move, minus its cute
  trademarked mascots. Like its inspiration, this game concerns itself for the
  player aiming and launching (within ten seconds, at which point launch
  automatically occurs) a coloured sphere up a narrow tunnel, ricocheting
  appropriately to (ideally) latch on to other spheres of the same colour --
  whereupon reaching bunches of three, they disappear.  Meanwhile, the "ceiling"
  periodically lowers (every six shots), gradually pushing each level's default
  and accumulated mass of bubbles closer to the launcher at the bottom; if they
  descend past it, the player loses a life and starts the level over again. Run
  with a special command-line switch ( -s), the game features power-up bubbles
  with special properties, and new level layouts can be designed solely through
  the use of a text editor.
