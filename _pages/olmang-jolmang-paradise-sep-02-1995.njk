description: "Olmang Jolmang Paradise is a Space Harrier -like arcade 3D shooter
  that allows one or two players to control characters from various Family
  Production. There are eight controllable characters in total: the two ships
  from Illusion Blaze; the two mechas from Iron Blood; the two anthropomorphic
  animal heroes from Pee & Gity; and Shakii with his wife from Shakii the Wolf.
  Each character has his or her unique weapons, such as boomerangs, throwing
  discs, guns, etc. Characters can also execute unique powerful attacks, which
  deplete their health: for example, Gity summons a giant crocodile head,
  Shakii's wife releases a swarm of flowers, and so on. Each pair of characters
  begins in a different stage, but eventually all of them share the same set.
  There are no power-ups in the stages themselves except money; however, the
  player can visit shops where this money can be spent on additional lives,
  sidekicks (\"options\"), tickets for a chicken race, etc."
