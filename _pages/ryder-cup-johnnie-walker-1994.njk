description: "Ryder Cup: Johnnie Walker is a golf game based on the Ryder Cup
  tournament of 1993 which was played on the Belfry course. When on the field,
  the player has various icons available which are used to display or hide
  information, e.g. about the current hole and wind. The game offers two
  different control methods for the shot: two-click (choosing the loft from a
  menu and then clicking twice with the correct timing to select the power and
  drift) and the stroke method (after selecting the power, a miniature ball
  appears and the player has to click on it. The position of the click sets
  where the club hits the ball and therefore the drift). The latter is also
  available in a variant in which the ball randomly moves to make it harder. The
  tournament itself is a match between a European and US team with twelve
  athletes each. There is also the possibility to train the single holes instead
  of participating in the tournament."
