description: An Olympiad game simulating common winter game competitions - the
  Downhill, Giant Slalom, Luge, 2-men Bobsled, Ski Jump, Cross Country, Biathlon
  and Speed Skating. The game features a basic 3D engine which allows to
  simulate slopes with ease, which enhances the gameplay of some events such as
  the Downhill. Gameplay, as expected from a Winter sports game, relies on
  finding the faster trajectories in most events (Downhill, Giant Slalom, Luge
  and Bobsled), pacing the run correctly (Cross Country and Biathlon), skill and
  timing (Ski Jump), with button mashing reserved for just one (speed skating).
  The player (up to ten) can select his (or her) competitor face and nationality
  from one of 16 possible choices, and by selecting different difficulty
  settings, different computer controlled athletes take part in the competition
  along the player.
