description: Eol-ui Moheom is a Korean-made colorful platformer starring the
  titular character Eol, a cute yellow anthropomorphic animal who must defeat an
  equally  animal-like anthropomorphic demon and his minions. Eol traverses
  linear stages, jumping on stationary and moving platforms, and defeating
  regular enemies and bosses. He fights with his tail, which releases a
  projectile attack; he can also use his tail to grab on poles and trees.
  Another ability Eol has is sliding, which can be used to avoid enemies and fit
  into narrow passages.
