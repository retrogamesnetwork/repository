description: Yet another text-mode variation on Tetris, where falling blocks
  have to be arranged and rotated to form solid rows, eliminate them and rack up
  score.  All the familiar tetramino blocks are here, plus a smaller double
  square block.  The speed increases every 10 lines completed, from level 0 to
  9; if you feel like a challenge, you can crank up the speed yourself (though
  once you do, there's no way to decrease it). As with many variants, you get to
  see the next piece (optionally), and some statistics showing the blocks used
  so far; you also get to track your high-score progress in real time, courtesy
  of a counter showing your current rank and the number of points remaining
  until the next one.
