description: Bluebush Chess is one of the first computer chess programs for
  personal PC computers and has large graphics where the chess board covers
  nearly the whole screen.  There are seven skill levels available plus postal
  chess. You can play black or white pieces and control them by selecting them
  through keyboard cursor movement.  The computer can play either side or both
  for a demonstration game.  You can set up and start play from any board
  position. The computer can also select the best move for you anytime. When the
  computer is thinking out its move, the cross on the King's crown flashes and
  the internal speaker sound is used to signify when each move is made along
  with the piece flashing before and after the move. The move list can be
  displayed on the screen, and you can also take back unwanted moves. The game
  has thousands of book opening moves and allows "en passant" pawn captures. All
  moves are checked for legality. The game is controlled via a menu system and
  you can change the play level, board setup, board color (15 different sets)
  and players color. In-game help info is also available.
