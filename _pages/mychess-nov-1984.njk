description: MYCHESS is one of the oldest chess games ever made. It was
  developed by David Kittinger (the man behind the famous Chessmaster games) in
  1979, although the DOS version was published in 1984. The game offers various
  configuration options to make adjustments for different hardware and doesn't
  have mouse support, so the standard chess notations have to be written on the
  keyboard to move the pieces. In MYCHESS you can only play against the computer
  and there are 9 levels of difficulty to chose from. Games can't be loaded or
  saved but you can set up the board at the beginning. The game also allows you
  to record the moves on the printer and provides time controls for timed games.
