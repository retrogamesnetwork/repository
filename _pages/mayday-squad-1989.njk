description: "In Mayday Squad, the Lutonian Embassy has been taken over by the
  Red Legion terror organisation and the ambassador's daughter has been
  kidnapped. The player takes the role of a group of three special agents which
  have to save her within a time limit. The player has to choose between nine
  soldiers which are divided into three categories: leader (shooting),
  demolition (grenades) and communication (opening locks and picking up items).
  The soldiers within the same category also have different advantages and
  weaknesses. Also chosen before starting the mission is the difficulty level
  and hit points of the team members. During the game itself, one member is
  controlled by the player and the others by the AI. However, to perform special
  actions it is possible to instantly switch between them. This is needed
  because there are a lot of options how to proceed in the maze-like embassy,
  e.g. players may choose to open a lock or shoot it open. While a large portion
  of the game is dedicated to finding the way and searching for clues which hint
  to the daughter's location, there are also strong action elements: When
  meeting enemies and controlling the leader, the cursor has to be quickly moved
  over the opponents to shoot them before they can damage the team. Resources
  like ammo are limited."
