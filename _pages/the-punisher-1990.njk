description: When his family was gunned down by gangsters, Frank Castle became
  The Punisher.  As Judge, Jury, and Executioner, The Punisher is cleaning up
  New York City one dead criminal at a time.  However, if he can raise $500,000,
  he can pay off an informant for the location of the biggest criminal in
  Manhattan, The Kingpin.  Working with a time limit and financed by The Trust,
  he only has a short time to complete enough missions to raise that much money.
  The Punisher primarily plays from a top-down perspective, where the player
  moves Frank through the streets and alleys of New York, entering buildings and
  taking out enemies with a range of weaponry.  He also drives to locations in
  his Battle Van, where the player controls the van from a first-person
  perspective, to the mission‚Äôs address.  The game also has a scrolling mode
  when Frank scuba dives and knifes underwater assailants on the way to boats.
