description: Berserker Raid is a 1 - 2 player science-fiction themed strategy
  game for multiple systems From time before human memory, great automated war
  machines were created by an unknown alien race.  These Berserkers, programmed
  to eliminate all life that they encounter, still roam the galaxy. Gameplay
  occurs in a 10 system star cluster.  Each player has a home base, and can send
  out merchant ships to establish production bases in other systems.  The
  player's goal is to strengthen defenses and construct a fleet of their own
  vessels to counter the Berserker threat.  The player can create customized
  ships that will take a varying number of resources to produce or choose from 5
  predefined vessels.  The player can possess a maximum fleet of 10
  vessels.  Each base has a technology and productivity statistic.  Technology
  defines how advanced of ship a base can build, while productivity determines
  how fast it can build.  Each base also has a defensive rating to determine
  their strength against Berserker attack. At a varying interval, the Berserker
  fleet will appear, and begin to hunt for your home base.  The bases's missiles
  will weaken the fleet, and then the player must enter into ship-to-ship
  combat, which is a strategy affair where ships takes turns attacking and
  defending.  Only 3 ships can engage at one time.  Victory is obtained by
  defeating all of the Berserker vessels, and repossessing all of your original
  bases. The game comes preloaded with 10 scenarios, and a corresponding
  vignette is available in the manual.  The player can also create their own
  novel scenarios.,
