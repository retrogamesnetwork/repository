description: "El Capit√°n Trueno (Captain Thunder) is the name of a famous
  Spanish comic book which tells the ongoing story of the eponymous 12th-century
  hero.  This is the first game dealing with the character, released to all of
  the Spanish-speaking world's most vital computing platforms at the time: ZX
  Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX and MS-DOS; all  ports except for the PC version
  contain two different segments, the first a calmer adventure portion followed
  by some frenetic arcade action. The final mission is to rescue Sigrid,
  Trueno's beloved, from the monastery of his friend Abbot Estanislao de
  Castiglione. Along the way, the Capit√°n will have to face giant spiders,
  skeleton soldiers, enormous rats and a plethora of imaginative creatures such
  as the Abbot transformed into a demonic goat. The Capit√°n strives to triumph
  over all these opponents with the assistance of his friends sturdy Goliath,
  who though immobile can lash out with meaty fists and jump in place to cause
  earthquakes, and nimble Crisp√≠n, a man who can shimmy up a rope of any
  length."
