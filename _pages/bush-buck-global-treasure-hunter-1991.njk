description: "Application software experts PC Globe Inc. made an advance into
  the gaming sector in the early 90’s within their field of expertise:
  geography. With a back catalog of several installments of the then-leading
  world atlas and almanac software, PC Globe, the company turned snippets of
  country-specific info into an educational game that mixed two-player “Identify
  that place” strategy with a “Get to know the globe” learning effect – can you
  say Carmen Sandiego? As the sinister Otto von Slinkenrat tries to pocket the
  world’s treasures in his private collection, renowned adventurer Bush Buck
  sets out to find and secure the valuable objects for posterity. In a race
  around the globe, you and an opponent travel back and forth between 206 cities
  in 175 countries in search for clues to the treasures’ whereabouts. Cities are
  connected by a network of plane routes; players take turns in jetting from one
  destination to the next. On each visit to a city, you learn some background
  info – e.g. about landmarks, geography, culture. Learning to place countries
  and cities on the globe is essential to finding the treasures, which are all
  linked to a specific place on Earth. If you know that a Samisen is a Japanese
  musical instrument, for example, you can make your way directly to Tokyo; if
  not, a set of clues that you collect on your travels will point out features
  of the target country and town which help narrow down your options – e.g.
  “It’s an island country”, “It’s in East Asia” etc. The first player to visit
  the target town collects the treasure and has to return it to his home base
  for a points reward. For each game, the computer selects 15 out of 400
  possible objects; if all are found or if both players run out of plane tickets
  (each flight costs one ticket), the game ends and whoever has amassed the most
  points wins. Three difficulty levels increase the AI strength and reduce
  helpful hints, making Bush Buck a challenge even for experienced globe
  trotters."
